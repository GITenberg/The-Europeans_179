description: Eugenia, an expatriated American, is the morganatic wife of a German
  prince, who is about to reject her in favor of a state marriage. With her artist
  brother Felix Young she travels to Boston to visit relatives she has never before
  seen, in hopes of making a wealthy marriage. The men of Boston soon realize her
  deceitfulness, and she returns to Europe, feeling that her fortune-hunting scheme
  is impractical in unsusceptible America. - Publisher.
