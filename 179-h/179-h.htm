    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      A narrow grave-yard in the heart of a bustling, indifferent city, seen
      from the windows of a gloomy-looking inn, is at no time an object of
      enlivening suggestion; and the spectacle is not at its best when the
      mouldy tombstones and funereal umbrage have received the ineffectual
      refreshment of a dull, moist snow-fall. If, while the air is thickened by
      this frosty drizzle, the calendar should happen to indicate that the
      blessed vernal season is already six weeks old, it will be admitted that
      no depressing influence is absent from the scene. This fact was keenly
      felt on a certain 12th of May, upwards of thirty years since, by a lady
      who stood looking out of one of the windows of the best hotel in the
      ancient city of Boston. She had stood there for half an hour&mdash;stood
      there, that is, at intervals; for from time to time she turned back into
      the room and measured its length with a restless step. In the
      chimney-place was a red-hot fire which emitted a small blue flame; and in
      front of the fire, at a table, sat a young man who was busily plying a
      pencil. He had a number of sheets of paper cut into small equal squares,
      and he was apparently covering them with pictorial designs&mdash;strange-looking
      figures. He worked rapidly and attentively, sometimes threw back his head
      and held out his drawing at arm&rsquo;s-length, and kept up a soft, gay-sounding
      humming and whistling. The lady brushed past him in her walk; her
      much-trimmed skirts were voluminous. She never dropped her eyes upon his
      work; she only turned them, occasionally, as she passed, to a mirror
      suspended above the toilet-table on the other side of the room. Here she
      paused a moment, gave a pinch to her waist with her two hands, or raised
      these members&mdash;they were very plump and pretty&mdash;to the multifold
      braids of her hair, with a movement half caressing, half corrective. An
      attentive observer might have fancied that during these periods of
      desultory self-inspection her face forgot its melancholy; but as soon as
      she neared the window again it began to proclaim that she was a very
      ill-pleased woman. And indeed, in what met her eyes there was little to be
      pleased with. The window-panes were battered by the sleet; the head-stones
      in the grave-yard beneath seemed to be holding themselves askance to keep
      it out of their faces. A tall iron railing protected them from the street,
      and on the other side of the railing an assemblage of Bostonians were
      trampling about in the liquid snow. Many of them were looking up and down;
      they appeared to be waiting for something. From time to time a strange
      vehicle drew near to the place where they stood,&mdash;such a vehicle as
      the lady at the window, in spite of a considerable acquaintance with human
      inventions, had never seen before: a huge, low omnibus, painted in
      brilliant colors, and decorated apparently with jangling bells, attached
      to a species of groove in the pavement, through which it was dragged, with
      a great deal of rumbling, bouncing and scratching, by a couple of
      remarkably small horses. When it reached a certain point the people in
      front of the grave-yard, of whom much the greater number were women,
      carrying satchels and parcels, projected themselves upon it in a compact
      body&mdash;a movement suggesting the scramble for places in a life-boat at
      sea&mdash;and were engulfed in its large interior. Then the life-boat&mdash;or
      the life-car, as the lady at the window of the hotel vaguely designated it&mdash;went
      bumping and jingling away upon its invisible wheels, with the helmsman
      (the man at the wheel) guiding its course incongruously from the prow.
      This phenomenon was repeated every three minutes, and the supply of
      eagerly-moving women in cloaks, bearing reticules and bundles, renewed
      itself in the most liberal manner. On the other side of the grave-yard was
      a row of small red brick houses, showing a series of homely,
      domestic-looking backs; at the end opposite the hotel a tall wooden
      church-spire, painted white, rose high into the vagueness of the
      snow-flakes. The lady at the window looked at it for some time; for
      reasons of her own she thought it the ugliest thing she had ever seen. She
      hated it, she despised it; it threw her into a state of irritation that
      was quite out of proportion to any sensible motive. She had never known
      herself to care so much about church-spires.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not pretty; but even when it expressed perplexed irritation her
      face was most interesting and agreeable. Neither was she in her first
      youth; yet, though slender, with a great deal of extremely well-fashioned
      roundness of contour&mdash;a suggestion both of maturity and flexibility&mdash;she
      carried her three and thirty years as a light-wristed Hebe might have
      carried a brimming wine-cup. Her complexion was fatigued, as the French
      say; her mouth was large, her lips too full, her teeth uneven, her chin
      rather commonly modeled; she had a thick nose, and when she smiled&mdash;she
      was constantly smiling&mdash;the lines beside it rose too high, toward her
      eyes. But these eyes were charming: gray in color, brilliant, quickly
      glancing, gently resting, full of intelligence. Her forehead was very low&mdash;it
      was her only handsome feature; and she had a great abundance of crisp dark
      hair, finely frizzled, which was always braided in a manner that suggested
      some Southern or Eastern, some remotely foreign, woman. She had a large
      collection of ear-rings, and wore them in alternation; and they seemed to
      give a point to her Oriental or exotic aspect. A compliment had once been
      paid her, which, being repeated to her, gave her greater pleasure than
      anything she had ever heard. &ldquo;A pretty woman?&rdquo; someone had said. &ldquo;Why,
      her features are very bad.&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about her features,&rdquo; a very
      discerning observer had answered; &ldquo;but she carries her head like a pretty
      woman.&rdquo; You may imagine whether, after this, she carried her head less
      becomingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned away from the window at last, pressing her hands to her eyes.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too horrible!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I shall go back&mdash;I shall go
      back!&rdquo; And she flung herself into a chair before the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a little, dear child,&rdquo; said the young man softly, sketching away at
      his little scraps of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady put out her foot; it was very small, and there was an immense
      rosette on her slipper. She fixed her eyes for a while on this ornament,
      and then she looked at the glowing bed of anthracite coal in the grate.
      &ldquo;Did you ever see anything so hideous as that fire?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;Did
      you ever see anything so&mdash;so <i>affreux</i> as&mdash;as everything?&rdquo; She
      spoke English with perfect purity; but she brought out this French epithet
      in a manner that indicated that she was accustomed to using French
      epithets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think the fire is very pretty,&rdquo; said the young man, glancing at it a
      moment. &ldquo;Those little blue tongues, dancing on top of the crimson embers,
      are extremely picturesque. They are like a fire in an alchemist&rsquo;s
      laboratory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too good-natured, my dear,&rdquo; his companion declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man held out one of his drawings, with his head on one side. His
      tongue was gently moving along his under-lip. &ldquo;Good-natured&mdash;yes. Too
      good-natured&mdash;no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are irritating,&rdquo; said the lady, looking at her slipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to retouch his sketch. &ldquo;I think you mean simply that you are
      irritated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, for that, yes!&rdquo; said his companion, with a little bitter laugh. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      the darkest day of my life&mdash;and you know what that means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till tomorrow,&rdquo; rejoined the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we have made a great mistake. If there is any doubt about it today,
      there certainly will be none tomorrow. <i>Ce sera clair, au moins!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man was silent a few moments, driving his pencil. Then at last,
      &ldquo;There are no such things as mistakes,&rdquo; he affirmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true&mdash;for those who are not clever enough to perceive them. Not
      to recognize one&rsquo;s mistakes&mdash;that would be happiness in life,&rdquo; the
      lady went on, still looking at her pretty foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dearest sister,&rdquo; said the young man, always intent upon his drawing,
      &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the first time you have told me I am not clever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, by your own theory I can&rsquo;t call it a mistake,&rdquo; answered his sister,
      pertinently enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man gave a clear, fresh laugh. &ldquo;You, at least, are clever
      enough, dearest sister,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not so when I proposed this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it you who proposed it?&rdquo; asked her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her head and gave him a little stare. &ldquo;Do you desire the credit
      of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you like, I will take the blame,&rdquo; he said, looking up with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she rejoined in a moment, &ldquo;you make no difference in these things.
      You have no sense of property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man gave his joyous laugh again. &ldquo;If that means I have no
      property, you are right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t joke about your poverty,&rdquo; said his sister. &ldquo;That is quite as vulgar
      as to boast about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poverty! I have just finished a drawing that will bring me fifty
      francs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Voyons,&rdquo;</i> said the lady, putting out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He added a touch or two, and then gave her his sketch. She looked at it,
      but she went on with her idea of a moment before. &ldquo;If a woman were to ask
      you to marry her you would say, &lsquo;Certainly, my dear, with pleasure!&rsquo; And
      you would marry her and be ridiculously happy. Then at the end of three
      months you would say to her, &lsquo;You know that blissful day when I begged you
      to be mine!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man had risen from the table, stretching his arms a little; he
      walked to the window. &ldquo;That is a description of a charming nature,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you have a charming nature; I regard that as our capital. If I
      had not been convinced of that I should never have taken the risk of
      bringing you to this dreadful country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This comical country, this delightful country!&rdquo; exclaimed the young man,
      and he broke into the most animated laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it those women scrambling into the omnibus?&rdquo; asked his companion.
      &ldquo;What do you suppose is the attraction?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose there is a very good-looking man inside,&rdquo; said the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In each of them? They come along in hundreds, and the men in this country
      don&rsquo;t seem at all handsome. As for the women&mdash;I have never seen so
      many at once since I left the convent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The women are very pretty,&rdquo; her brother declared, &ldquo;and the whole affair
      is very amusing. I must make a sketch of it.&rdquo; And he came back to the
      table quickly, and picked up his utensils&mdash;a small sketching-board, a
      sheet of paper, and three or four crayons. He took his place at the window
      with these things, and stood there glancing out, plying his pencil with an
      air of easy skill. While he worked he wore a brilliant smile. Brilliant is
      indeed the word at this moment for his strongly-lighted face. He was eight
      and twenty years old; he had a short, slight, well-made figure. Though he
      bore a noticeable resemblance to his sister, he was a better favored
      person: fair-haired, clear-faced, witty-looking, with a delicate finish of
      feature and an expression at once urbane and not at all serious, a warm
      blue eye, an eyebrow finely drawn and excessively arched&mdash;an eyebrow
      which, if ladies wrote sonnets to those of their lovers, might have been
      made the subject of such a piece of verse&mdash;and a light moustache that
      flourished upwards as if blown that way by the breath of a constant smile.
      There was something in his physiognomy at once benevolent and picturesque.
      But, as I have hinted, it was not at all serious. The young man&rsquo;s face
      was, in this respect, singular; it was not at all serious, and yet it
      inspired the liveliest confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be sure you put in plenty of snow,&rdquo; said his sister. &ldquo;<i>Bonté divine</i>, what
      a climate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall leave the sketch all white, and I shall put in the little figures
      in black,&rdquo; the young man answered, laughing. &ldquo;And I shall call it&mdash;what
      is that line in Keats?&mdash;Mid-May&rsquo;s Eldest Child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;that mamma ever told me it was like
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma never told you anything disagreeable. And it&rsquo;s not like this&mdash;every
      day. You will see that tomorrow we shall have a splendid day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Qu&rsquo;en savez-vous?</i> Tomorrow I shall go away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where shall you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anywhere away from here. Back to Silberstadt. I shall write to the
      Reigning Prince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man turned a little and looked at her, with his crayon poised.
      &ldquo;My dear Eugenia,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;were you so happy at sea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenia got up; she still held in her hand the drawing her brother had
      given her. It was a bold, expressive sketch of a group of miserable people
      on the deck of a steamer, clinging together and clutching at each other,
      while the vessel lurched downward, at a terrific angle, into the hollow of
      a wave. It was extremely clever, and full of a sort of tragi-comical
      power. Eugenia dropped her eyes upon it and made a sad grimace. &ldquo;How can
      you draw such odious scenes?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I should like to throw it into
      the fire!&rdquo; And she tossed the paper away. Her brother watched, quietly, to
      see where it went. It fluttered down to the floor, where he let it lie.
      She came toward the window, pinching in her waist. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you reproach
      me&mdash;abuse me?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I think I should feel better then. Why
      don&rsquo;t you tell me that you hate me for bringing you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you would not believe it. I adore you, dear sister! I am
      delighted to be here, and I am charmed with the prospect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what had taken possession of me. I had lost my head,&rdquo;
       Eugenia went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man, on his side, went on plying his pencil. &ldquo;It is evidently a
      most curious and interesting country. Here we are, and I mean to enjoy
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His companion turned away with an impatient step, but presently came back.
      &ldquo;High spirits are doubtless an excellent thing,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but you give
      one too much of them, and I can&rsquo;t see that they have done you any good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man stared, with lifted eyebrows, smiling; he tapped his
      handsome nose with his pencil. &ldquo;They have made me happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was the least they could do; they have made you nothing else. You
      have gone through life thanking fortune for such very small favors that
      she has never put herself to any trouble for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must have put herself to a little, I think, to present me with so
      admirable a sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be serious, Felix. You forget that I am your elder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a sister, then, so elderly!&rdquo; rejoined Felix, laughing. &ldquo;I hoped we
      had left seriousness in Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy you will find it here. Remember that you are nearly thirty years
      old, and that you are nothing but an obscure Bohemian&mdash;a penniless
      correspondent of an illustrated newspaper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Obscure as much as you please, but not so much of a Bohemian as you
      think. And not at all penniless! I have a hundred pounds in my pocket. I
      have an engagement to make fifty sketches, and I mean to paint the
      portraits of all our cousins, and of all <i>their</i> cousins, at a hundred
      dollars a head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not ambitious,&rdquo; said Eugenia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are, dear Baroness,&rdquo; the young man replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness was silent a moment, looking out at the sleet-darkened
      grave-yard and the bumping horse-cars. &ldquo;Yes, I am ambitious,&rdquo; she said at
      last. &ldquo;And my ambition has brought me to this dreadful place!&rdquo; She glanced
      about her&mdash;the room had a certain vulgar nudity; the bed and the
      window were curtainless&mdash;and she gave a little passionate sigh. &ldquo;Poor
      old ambition!&rdquo; she exclaimed. Then she flung herself down upon a sofa
      which stood near against the wall, and covered her face with her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her brother went on with his drawing, rapidly and skillfully; after some
      moments he sat down beside her and showed her his sketch. &ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t you
      think that&rsquo;s pretty good for an obscure Bohemian?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I have
      knocked off another fifty francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenia glanced at the little picture as he laid it on her lap. &ldquo;Yes, it
      is very clever,&rdquo; she said. And in a moment she added, &ldquo;Do you suppose our
      cousins do that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get into those things, and look like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix meditated awhile. &ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t say. It will be interesting to
      discover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the rich people can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said the Baroness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you very sure they are rich?&rdquo; asked Felix, lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His sister slowly turned in her place, looking at him. &ldquo;Heavenly powers!&rdquo;
       she murmured. &ldquo;You have a way of bringing out things!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will certainly be much pleasanter if they are rich,&rdquo; Felix declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose if I had not known they were rich I would ever have come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man met his sister&rsquo;s somewhat peremptory eye with his bright,
      contented glance. &ldquo;Yes, it certainly will be pleasanter,&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all I expect of them,&rdquo; said the Baroness. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t count upon
      their being clever or friendly&mdash;at first&mdash;or elegant or
      interesting. But I assure you I insist upon their being rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix leaned his head upon the back of the sofa and looked awhile at the
      oblong patch of sky to which the window served as frame. The snow was
      ceasing; it seemed to him that the sky had begun to brighten. &ldquo;I count
      upon their being rich,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;and powerful, and clever, and
      friendly, and elegant, and interesting, and generally delightful! <i>Tu vas
      voir</i>.&rdquo; And he bent forward and kissed his sister. &ldquo;Look there!&rdquo; he went
      on. &ldquo;As a portent, even while I speak, the sky is turning the color of
      gold; the day is going to be splendid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And indeed, within five minutes the weather had changed. The sun broke out
      through the snow-clouds and jumped into the Baroness&rsquo;s room. &ldquo;<i>Bonté
      divine</i>,&rdquo; exclaimed this lady, &ldquo;what a climate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will go out and see the world,&rdquo; said Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      And after a while they went out. The air had grown warm as well as
      brilliant; the sunshine had dried the pavements. They walked about the
      streets at hazard, looking at the people and the houses, the shops and the
      vehicles, the blazing blue sky and the muddy crossings, the hurrying men
      and the slow-strolling maidens, the fresh red bricks and the bright green
      trees, the extraordinary mixture of smartness and shabbiness. From one
      hour to another the day had grown vernal; even in the bustling streets
      there was an odor of earth and blossom. Felix was immensely entertained.
      He had called it a comical country, and he went about laughing at
      everything he saw. You would have said that American civilization
      expressed itself to his sense in a tissue of capital jokes. The jokes were
      certainly excellent, and the young man&rsquo;s merriment was joyous and genial.
      He possessed what is called the pictorial sense; and this first glimpse of
      democratic manners stirred the same sort of attention that he would have
      given to the movements of a lively young person with a bright complexion.
      Such attention would have been demonstrative and complimentary; and in the
      present case Felix might have passed for an undispirited young exile
      revisiting the haunts of his childhood. He kept looking at the violent
      blue of the sky, at the scintillating air, at the scattered and multiplied
      patches of color.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Comme c&rsquo;est bariolé</i>, eh?&rdquo; he said to his sister in that foreign tongue
      which they both appeared to feel a mysterious prompting occasionally to
      use.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is <i>bariolé</i> indeed,&rdquo; the Baroness answered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the
      coloring; it hurts my eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shows how extremes meet,&rdquo; the young man rejoined. &ldquo;Instead of coming
      to the West we seem to have gone to the East. The way the sky touches the
      house-tops is just like Cairo; and the red and blue sign-boards patched
      over the face of everything remind one of Mahometan decorations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young women are not Mahometan,&rdquo; said his companion. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t be
      said to hide their faces. I never saw anything so bold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank Heaven they don&rsquo;t hide their faces!&rdquo; cried Felix. &ldquo;Their faces are
      uncommonly pretty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, their faces are often very pretty,&rdquo; said the Baroness, who was a
      very clever woman. She was too clever a woman not to be capable of a great
      deal of just and fine observation. She clung more closely than usual to
      her brother&rsquo;s arm; she was not exhilarated, as he was; she said very
      little, but she noted a great many things and made her reflections. She
      was a little excited; she felt that she had indeed come to a strange
      country, to make her fortune. Superficially, she was conscious of a good
      deal of irritation and displeasure; the Baroness was a very delicate and
      fastidious person. Of old, more than once, she had gone, for
      entertainment&rsquo;s sake and in brilliant company, to a fair in a provincial
      town. It seemed to her now that she was at an enormous fair&mdash;that the
      entertainment and the <i>désagréments</i> were very much the same. She found
      herself alternately smiling and shrinking; the show was very curious, but
      it was probable, from moment to moment, that one would be jostled. The
      Baroness had never seen so many people walking about before; she had never
      been so mixed up with people she did not know. But little by little she
      felt that this fair was a more serious undertaking. She went with her
      brother into a large public garden, which seemed very pretty, but where
      she was surprised at seeing no carriages. The afternoon was drawing to a
      close; the coarse, vivid grass and the slender tree-boles were gilded by
      the level sunbeams&mdash;gilded as with gold that was fresh from the mine.
      It was the hour at which ladies should come out for an airing and roll
      past a hedge of pedestrians, holding their parasols askance. Here,
      however, Eugenia observed no indications of this custom, the absence of
      which was more anomalous as there was a charming avenue of remarkably
      graceful, arching elms in the most convenient contiguity to a large,
      cheerful street, in which, evidently, among the more prosperous members of
      the <i>bourgeoisie</i>, a great deal of pedestrianism went forward. Our friends
      passed out into this well lighted promenade, and Felix noticed a great
      many more pretty girls and called his sister&rsquo;s attention to them. This
      latter measure, however, was superfluous; for the Baroness had inspected,
      narrowly, these charming young ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel an intimate conviction that our cousins are like that,&rdquo; said
      Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness hoped so, but this is not what she said. &ldquo;They are very
      pretty,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but they are mere little girls. Where are the women&mdash;the
      women of thirty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of thirty-three, do you mean?&rdquo; her brother was going to ask; for he
      understood often both what she said and what she did not say. But he only
      exclaimed upon the beauty of the sunset, while the Baroness, who had come
      to seek her fortune, reflected that it would certainly be well for her if
      the persons against whom she might need to measure herself should all be
      mere little girls. The sunset was superb; they stopped to look at it;
      Felix declared that he had never seen such a gorgeous mixture of colors.
      The Baroness also thought it splendid; and she was perhaps the more easily
      pleased from the fact that while she stood there she was conscious of much
      admiring observation on the part of various nice-looking people who passed
      that way, and to whom a distinguished, strikingly-dressed woman with a
      foreign air, exclaiming upon the beauties of nature on a Boston street
      corner in the French tongue, could not be an object of indifference.
      Eugenia&rsquo;s spirits rose. She surrendered herself to a certain tranquil
      gaiety. If she had come to seek her fortune, it seemed to her that her
      fortune would be easy to find. There was a promise of it in the gorgeous
      purity of the western sky; there was an intimation in the mild,
      unimpertinent gaze of the passers of a certain natural facility in things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not go back to Silberstadt, eh?&rdquo; asked Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not tomorrow,&rdquo; said the Baroness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor write to the Reigning Prince?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall write to him that they evidently know nothing about him over
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will not believe you,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;I advise you to let him
      alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix himself continued to be in high good humor. Brought up among ancient
      customs and in picturesque cities, he yet found plenty of local color in
      the little Puritan metropolis. That evening, after dinner, he told his
      sister that he should go forth early on the morrow to look up their
      cousins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very impatient,&rdquo; said Eugenia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can be more natural,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;after seeing all those pretty girls
      today? If one&rsquo;s cousins are of that pattern, the sooner one knows them
      the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps they are not,&rdquo; said Eugenia. &ldquo;We ought to have brought some
      letters&mdash;to some other people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other people would not be our kinsfolk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly they would be none the worse for that,&rdquo; the Baroness replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her brother looked at her with his eyebrows lifted. &ldquo;That was not what you
      said when you first proposed to me that we should come out here and
      fraternize with our relatives. You said that it was the prompting of
      natural affection; and when I suggested some reasons against it you
      declared that the <i>voix du sang</i> should go before everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember all that?&rdquo; asked the Baroness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vividly! I was greatly moved by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was walking up and down the room, as she had done in the morning; she
      stopped in her walk and looked at her brother. She apparently was going to
      say something, but she checked herself and resumed her walk. Then, in a
      few moments, she said something different, which had the effect of an
      explanation of the suppression of her earlier thought. &ldquo;You will never be
      anything but a child, dear brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One would suppose that you, madam,&rdquo; answered Felix, laughing, &ldquo;were a
      thousand years old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am&mdash;sometimes,&rdquo; said the Baroness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go, then, and announce to our cousins the arrival of a personage
      so extraordinary. They will immediately come and pay you their respects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenia paced the length of the room again, and then she stopped before
      her brother, laying her hand upon his arm. &ldquo;They are not to come and see
      me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You are not to allow that. That is not the way I shall
      meet them first.&rdquo; And in answer to his interrogative glance she went on.
      &ldquo;You will go and examine, and report. You will come back and tell me who
      they are and what they are; their number, gender, their respective ages&mdash;all
      about them. Be sure you observe everything; be ready to describe to me the
      locality, the accessories&mdash;how shall I say it?&mdash;the <i>mise en
      scène</i>. Then, at my own time, at my own hour, under circumstances of my own
      choosing, I will go to them. I will present myself&mdash;I will appear
      before them!&rdquo; said the Baroness, this time phrasing her idea with a
      certain frankness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what message am I to take to them?&rdquo; asked Felix, who had a lively
      faith in the justness of his sister&rsquo;s arrangements.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him a moment&mdash;at his expression of agreeable veracity;
      and, with that justness that he admired, she replied, &ldquo;Say what you
      please. Tell my story in the way that seems to you most&mdash;natural.&rdquo;
       And she bent her forehead for him to kiss.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day was splendid, as Felix had prophesied; if the winter had
      suddenly leaped into spring, the spring had for the moment as quickly
      leaped into summer. This was an observation made by a young girl who came
      out of a large square house in the country, and strolled about in the
      spacious garden which separated it from a muddy road. The flowering shrubs
      and the neatly-disposed plants were basking in the abundant light and
      warmth; the transparent shade of the great elms&mdash;they were
      magnificent trees&mdash;seemed to thicken by the hour; and the intensely
      habitual stillness offered a submissive medium to the sound of a distant
      church-bell. The young girl listened to the church-bell; but she was not
      dressed for church. She was bare-headed; she wore a white muslin waist,
      with an embroidered border, and the skirt of her dress was of colored
      muslin. She was a young lady of some two or three and twenty years of age,
      and though a young person of her sex walking bare-headed in a garden, of a
      Sunday morning in spring-time, can, in the nature of things, never be a
      displeasing object, you would not have pronounced this innocent
      Sabbath-breaker especially pretty. She was tall and pale, thin and a
      little awkward; her hair was fair and perfectly straight; her eyes were
      dark, and they had the singularity of seeming at once dull and restless&mdash;differing
      herein, as you see, fatally from the ideal &ldquo;fine eyes,&rdquo; which we always
      imagine to be both brilliant and tranquil. The doors and windows of the
      large square house were all wide open, to admit the purifying sunshine,
      which lay in generous patches upon the floor of a wide, high, covered
      piazza adjusted to two sides of the mansion&mdash;a piazza on which
      several straw-bottomed rocking-chairs and half a dozen of those small
      cylindrical stools in green and blue porcelain, which suggest an
      affiliation between the residents and the Eastern trade, were
      symmetrically disposed. It was an ancient house&mdash;ancient in the sense
      of being eighty years old; it was built of wood, painted a clean, clear,
      faded gray, and adorned along the front, at intervals, with flat wooden
      pilasters, painted white. These pilasters appeared to support a kind of
      classic pediment, which was decorated in the middle by a large triple
      window in a boldly carved frame, and in each of its smaller angles by a
      glazed circular aperture. A large white door, furnished with a
      highly-polished brass knocker, presented itself to the rural-looking road,
      with which it was connected by a spacious pathway, paved with worn and
      cracked, but very clean, bricks. Behind it there were meadows and
      orchards, a barn and a pond; and facing it, a short distance along the
      road, on the opposite side, stood a smaller house, painted white, with
      external shutters painted green, a little garden on one hand and an
      orchard on the other. All this was shining in the morning air, through
      which the simple details of the picture addressed themselves to the eye as
      distinctly as the items of a &ldquo;sum&rdquo; in addition.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second young lady presently came out of the house, across the piazza,
      descended into the garden and approached the young girl of whom I have
      spoken. This second young lady was also thin and pale; but she was older
      than the other; she was shorter; she had dark, smooth hair. Her eyes,
      unlike the other&rsquo;s, were quick and bright; but they were not at all
      restless. She wore a straw bonnet with white ribbons, and a long, red,
      India scarf, which, on the front of her dress, reached to her feet. In her
      hand she carried a little key.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gertrude,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;are you very sure you had better not go to church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude looked at her a moment, plucked a small sprig from a lilac-bush,
      smelled it and threw it away. &ldquo;I am not very sure of anything!&rdquo; she
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other young lady looked straight past her, at the distant pond, which
      lay shining between the long banks of fir trees. Then she said in a very
      soft voice, &ldquo;This is the key of the dining-room closet. I think you had
      better have it, if anyone should want anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is there to want anything?&rdquo; Gertrude demanded. &ldquo;I shall be all alone
      in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Someone may come,&rdquo; said her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean Mr. Brand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Gertrude. He may like a piece of cake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like men that are always eating cake!&rdquo; Gertrude declared, giving
      a pull at the lilac-bush.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her companion glanced at her, and then looked down on the ground. &ldquo;I think
      father expected you would come to church,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What shall I say to
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say I have a bad headache.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would that be true?&rdquo; asked the elder lady, looking straight at the pond
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Charlotte,&rdquo; said the younger one simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charlotte transferred her quiet eyes to her companion&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I am afraid
      you are feeling restless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am feeling as I always feel,&rdquo; Gertrude replied, in the same tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charlotte turned away; but she stood there a moment. Presently she looked
      down at the front of her dress. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it seem to you, somehow, as if
      my scarf were too long?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude walked half round her, looking at the scarf. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you
      wear it right,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should I wear it, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; differently from that. You should draw it differently over
      your shoulders, round your elbows; you should look differently behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should I look?&rdquo; Charlotte inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I can tell you,&rdquo; said Gertrude, plucking out the scarf a
      little behind. &ldquo;I could do it myself, but I don&rsquo;t think I can explain it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charlotte, by a movement of her elbows, corrected the laxity that had come
      from her companion&rsquo;s touch. &ldquo;Well, some day you must do it for me. It
      doesn&rsquo;t matter now. Indeed, I don&rsquo;t think it matters,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;how one
      looks behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say it mattered more,&rdquo; said Gertrude. &ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t know who
      may be observing you. You are not on your guard. You can&rsquo;t try to look
      pretty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charlotte received this declaration with extreme gravity. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
      one should ever try to look pretty,&rdquo; she rejoined, earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her companion was silent. Then she said, &ldquo;Well, perhaps it&rsquo;s not of much
      use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charlotte looked at her a little, and then kissed her. &ldquo;I hope you will be
      better when we come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sister, I am very well!&rdquo; said Gertrude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charlotte went down the large brick walk to the garden gate; her companion
      strolled slowly toward the house. At the gate Charlotte met a young man,
      who was coming in&mdash;a tall, fair young man, wearing a high hat and a
      pair of thread gloves. He was handsome, but rather too stout. He had a
      pleasant smile. &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Brand!&rdquo; exclaimed the young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to see whether your sister was not going to church,&rdquo; said the
      young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She says she is not going; but I am very glad you have come. I think if
      you were to talk to her a little&rdquo;.... And Charlotte lowered her voice. &ldquo;It
      seems as if she were restless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brand smiled down on the young lady from his great height. &ldquo;I shall be
      very glad to talk to her. For that I should be willing to absent myself
      from almost any occasion of worship, however attractive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I suppose you know,&rdquo; said Charlotte, softly, as if positive
      acceptance of this proposition might be dangerous. &ldquo;But I am afraid I
      shall be late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will have a pleasant sermon,&rdquo; said the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Gilman is always pleasant,&rdquo; Charlotte answered. And she went on
      her way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brand went into the garden, where Gertrude, hearing the gate close
      behind him, turned and looked at him. For a moment she watched him coming;
      then she turned away. But almost immediately she corrected this movement,
      and stood still, facing him. He took off his hat and wiped his forehead as
      he approached. Then he put on his hat again and held out his hand. His hat
      being removed, you would have perceived that his forehead was very large
      and smooth, and his hair abundant but rather colorless. His nose was too
      large, and his mouth and eyes were too small; but for all this he was, as
      I have said, a young man of striking appearance. The expression of his
      little clean-colored blue eyes was irresistibly gentle and serious; he
      looked, as the phrase is, as good as gold. The young girl, standing in the
      garden path, glanced, as he came up, at his thread gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hoped you were going to church,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wanted to walk with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very much obliged to you,&rdquo; Gertrude answered. &ldquo;I am not going to
      church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had shaken hands with him; he held her hand a moment. &ldquo;Have you any
      special reason for not going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mr. Brand,&rdquo; said the young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask what it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him smiling; and in her smile, as I have intimated, there
      was a certain dullness. But mingled with this dullness was something sweet
      and suggestive. &ldquo;Because the sky is so blue!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at the sky, which was magnificent, and then said, smiling too,
      &ldquo;I have heard of young ladies staying at home for bad weather, but never
      for good. Your sister, whom I met at the gate, tells me you are
      depressed,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Depressed? I am never depressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, surely, sometimes,&rdquo; replied Mr. Brand, as if he thought this a
      regrettable account of one&rsquo;s self.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am never depressed,&rdquo; Gertrude repeated. &ldquo;But I am sometimes wicked.
      When I am wicked I am in high spirits. I was wicked just now to my
      sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said things that puzzled her&mdash;on purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you do that, Miss Gertrude?&rdquo; asked the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to smile again. &ldquo;Because the sky is so blue!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say things that puzzle <i>me</i>,&rdquo; Mr. Brand declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always know when I do it,&rdquo; proceeded Gertrude. &ldquo;But people puzzle me
      more, I think. And they don&rsquo;t seem to know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is very interesting,&rdquo; Mr. Brand observed, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told me to tell you about my&mdash;my struggles,&rdquo; the young girl went
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us talk about them. I have so many things to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude turned away a moment; and then, turning back, &ldquo;You had better go
      to church,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; the young man urged, &ldquo;that I have always one thing to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude looked at him a moment. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t say it now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are all alone,&rdquo; he continued, taking off his hat; &ldquo;all alone in this
      beautiful Sunday stillness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude looked around her, at the breaking buds, the shining distance,
      the blue sky to which she had referred as a pretext for her
      irregularities. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the reason,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;why I don&rsquo;t want you to
      speak. Do me a favor; go to church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I speak when I come back?&rdquo; asked Mr. Brand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are still disposed,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether you are wicked,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but you are certainly
      puzzling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had turned away; she raised her hands to her ears. He looked at her a
      moment, and then he slowly walked to church.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wandered for a while about the garden, vaguely and without purpose.
      The church-bell had stopped ringing; the stillness was complete. This
      young lady relished highly, on occasions, the sense of being alone&mdash;the
      absence of the whole family and the emptiness of the house. Today,
      apparently, the servants had also gone to church; there was never a figure
      at the open windows; behind the house there was no stout negress in a red
      turban, lowering the bucket into the great shingle-hooded well. And the
      front door of the big, unguarded home stood open, with the trustfulness of
      the golden age; or what is more to the purpose, with that of New England&rsquo;s
      silvery prime. Gertrude slowly passed through it, and went from one of the
      empty rooms to the other&mdash;large, clear-colored rooms, with white
      wainscots, ornamented with thin-legged mahogany furniture, and, on the
      walls, with old-fashioned engravings, chiefly of scriptural subjects, hung
      very high. This agreeable sense of solitude, of having the house to
      herself, of which I have spoken, always excited Gertrude&rsquo;s imagination;
      she could not have told you why, and neither can her humble historian. It
      always seemed to her that she must do something particular&mdash;that she
      must honor the occasion; and while she roamed about, wondering what she
      could do, the occasion usually came to an end. Today she wondered more
      than ever. At last she took down a book; there was no library in the
      house, but there were books in all the rooms. None of them were forbidden
      books, and Gertrude had not stopped at home for the sake of a chance to
      climb to the inaccessible shelves. She possessed herself of a very obvious
      volume&mdash;one of the series of the <i>Arabian Nights</i>&mdash;and she brought
      it out into the portico and sat down with it in her lap. There, for a
      quarter of an hour, she read the history of the loves of the Prince
      Camaralzaman and the Princess Badoura. At last, looking up, she beheld, as
      it seemed to her, the Prince Camaralzaman standing before her. A beautiful
      young man was making her a very low bow&mdash;a magnificent bow, such as
      she had never seen before. He appeared to have dropped from the clouds; he
      was wonderfully handsome; he smiled&mdash;smiled as if he were smiling on
      purpose. Extreme surprise, for a moment, kept Gertrude sitting still; then
      she rose, without even keeping her finger in her book. The young man, with
      his hat in his hand, still looked at her, smiling and smiling. It was very
      strange.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you kindly tell me,&rdquo; said the mysterious visitor, at last, &ldquo;whether
      I have the honor of speaking to Miss Wentworth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Gertrude Wentworth,&rdquo; murmured the young woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;then&mdash;I have the honor&mdash;the pleasure&mdash;of being
      your cousin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man had so much the character of an apparition that this
      announcement seemed to complete his unreality. &ldquo;What cousin? Who are you?&rdquo;
       said Gertrude.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped back a few paces and looked up at the house; then glanced round
      him at the garden and the distant view. After this he burst out laughing.
      &ldquo;I see it must seem to you very strange,&rdquo; he said. There was, after all,
      something substantial in his laughter. Gertrude looked at him from head to
      foot. Yes, he was remarkably handsome; but his smile was almost a grimace.
      &ldquo;It is very still,&rdquo; he went on, coming nearer again. And as she only
      looked at him, for reply, he added, &ldquo;Are you all alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everyone has gone to church,&rdquo; said Gertrude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid of that!&rdquo; the young man exclaimed. &ldquo;But I hope you are not
      afraid of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to tell me who you are,&rdquo; Gertrude answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid of you!&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;I had a different plan. I
      expected the servant would take in my card, and that you would put your
      heads together, before admitting me, and make out my identity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude had been wondering with a quick intensity which brought its
      result; and the result seemed an answer&mdash;a wondrous, delightful
      answer&mdash;to her vague wish that something would befall her. &ldquo;I know&mdash;I
      know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You come from Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We came two days ago. You have heard of us, then&mdash;you believe in
      us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have known, vaguely,&rdquo; said Gertrude, &ldquo;that we had relations in
      France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have you ever wanted to see us?&rdquo; asked the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude was silent a moment. &ldquo;I have wanted to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad, then, it is you I have found. We wanted to see you, so we
      came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On purpose?&rdquo; asked Gertrude.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man looked round him, smiling still. &ldquo;Well, yes; on purpose.
      Does that sound as if we should bore you?&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we
      shall&mdash;I really don&rsquo;t think we shall. We are rather fond of
      wandering, too; and we were glad of a pretext.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have just arrived?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Boston, two days ago. At the inn I asked for Mr. Wentworth. He must be
      your father. They found out for me where he lived; they seemed often to
      have heard of him. I determined to come, without ceremony. So, this lovely
      morning, they set my face in the right direction, and told me to walk
      straight before me, out of town. I came on foot because I wanted to see
      the country. I walked and walked, and here I am! It&rsquo;s a good many miles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is seven miles and a half,&rdquo; said Gertrude, softly. Now that this
      handsome young man was proving himself a reality she found herself vaguely
      trembling; she was deeply excited. She had never in her life spoken to a
      foreigner, and she had often thought it would be delightful to do so. Here
      was one who had suddenly been engendered by the Sabbath stillness for her
      private use; and such a brilliant, polite, smiling one! She found time and
      means to compose herself, however: to remind herself that she must
      exercise a sort of official hospitality. &ldquo;We are very&mdash;very glad to
      see you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come into the house?&rdquo; And she moved toward
      the open door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not afraid of me, then?&rdquo; asked the young man again, with his
      light laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wondered a moment, and then, &ldquo;We are not afraid&mdash;here,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Ah, comme vous devez avoir raison!&rdquo;</i> cried the young man, looking all
      round him, appreciatively. It was the first time that Gertrude had heard
      so many words of French spoken. They gave her something of a sensation.
      Her companion followed her, watching, with a certain excitement of his
      own, this tall, interesting-looking girl, dressed in her clear, crisp
      muslin. He paused in the hall, where there was a broad white staircase
      with a white balustrade. &ldquo;What a pleasant house!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lighter
      inside than it is out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pleasanter here,&rdquo; said Gertrude, and she led the way into the
      parlor,&mdash;a high, clean, rather empty-looking room. Here they stood
      looking at each other,&mdash;the young man smiling more than ever;
      Gertrude, very serious, trying to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you know my name,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am called Felix Young.
      Your father is my uncle. My mother was his half sister, and older than
      he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Gertrude, &ldquo;and she turned Roman Catholic and married in
      Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you know,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;She married and she died. Your
      father&rsquo;s family didn&rsquo;t like her husband. They called him a foreigner; but
      he was not. My poor father was born in Sicily, but his parents were
      American.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Sicily?&rdquo; Gertrude murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said Felix Young, &ldquo;that they had spent their lives in
      Europe. But they were very patriotic. And so are we.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are Sicilian,&rdquo; said Gertrude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sicilian, no! Let&rsquo;s see. I was born at a little place&mdash;a dear
      little place&mdash;in France. My sister was born at Vienna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are French,&rdquo; said Gertrude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven forbid!&rdquo; cried the young man. Gertrude&rsquo;s eyes were fixed upon him
      almost insistently. He began to laugh again. &ldquo;I can easily be French, if
      that will please you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a foreigner of some sort,&rdquo; said Gertrude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of some sort&mdash;yes; I suppose so. But who can say of what sort? I
      don&rsquo;t think we have ever had occasion to settle the question. You know
      there are people like that. About their country, their religion, their
      profession, they can&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude stood there gazing; she had not asked him to sit down. She had
      never heard of people like that; she wanted to hear. &ldquo;Where do you live?&rdquo;
       she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t tell that, either!&rdquo; said Felix. &ldquo;I am afraid you will think
      they are little better than vagabonds. I have lived anywhere&mdash;everywhere.
      I really think I have lived in every city in Europe.&rdquo; Gertrude gave a
      little long soft exhalation. It made the young man smile at her again; and
      his smile made her blush a little. To take refuge from blushing she asked
      him if, after his long walk, he was not hungry or thirsty. Her hand was in
      her pocket; she was fumbling with the little key that her sister had given
      her. &ldquo;Ah, my dear young lady,&rdquo; he said, clasping his hands a little, &ldquo;if
      you could give me, in charity, a glass of wine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude gave a smile and a little nod, and went quickly out of the room.
      Presently she came back with a very large decanter in one hand and a plate
      in the other, on which was placed a big, round cake with a frosted top.
      Gertrude, in taking the cake from the closet, had had a moment of acute
      consciousness that it composed the refection of which her sister had
      thought that Mr. Brand would like to partake. Her kinsman from across the
      seas was looking at the pale, high-hung engravings. When she came in he
      turned and smiled at her, as if they had been old friends meeting after a
      separation. &ldquo;You wait upon me yourself?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I am served like the
      gods!&rdquo; She had waited upon a great many people, but none of them had ever
      told her that. The observation added a certain lightness to the step with
      which she went to a little table where there were some curious red glasses&mdash;glasses
      covered with little gold sprigs, which Charlotte used to dust every
      morning with her own hands. Gertrude thought the glasses very handsome,
      and it was a pleasure to her to know that the wine was good; it was her
      father&rsquo;s famous madeira. Felix Young thought it excellent; he wondered why
      he had been told that there was no wine in America. She cut him an immense
      triangle out of the cake, and again she thought of Mr. Brand. Felix sat
      there, with his glass in one hand and his huge morsel of cake in the other&mdash;eating,
      drinking, smiling, talking. &ldquo;I am very hungry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am not at all
      tired; I am never tired. But I am very hungry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must stay to dinner,&rdquo; said Gertrude. &ldquo;At two o&rsquo;clock. They will all
      have come back from church; you will see the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are the others?&rdquo; asked the young man. &ldquo;Describe them all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will see for yourself. It is you that must tell me; now, about your
      sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sister is the Baroness Münster,&rdquo; said Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      On hearing that his sister was a Baroness, Gertrude got up and walked
      about slowly, in front of him. She was silent a moment. She was thinking
      of it. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t she come, too?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did come; she is in Boston, at the hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will go and see her,&rdquo; said Gertrude, looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She begs you will not!&rdquo; the young man replied. &ldquo;She sends you her love;
      she sent me to announce her. She will come and pay her respects to your
      father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude felt herself trembling again. A Baroness Münster, who sent a
      brilliant young man to &ldquo;announce&rdquo; her; who was coming, as the Queen of
      Sheba came to Solomon, to pay her &ldquo;respects&rdquo; to quiet Mr. Wentworth&mdash;such
      a personage presented herself to Gertrude&rsquo;s vision with a most effective
      unexpectedness. For a moment she hardly knew what to say. &ldquo;When will she
      come?&rdquo; she asked at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as you will allow her&mdash;tomorrow. She is very impatient,&rdquo;
       answered Felix, who wished to be agreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tomorrow, yes,&rdquo; said Gertrude. She wished to ask more about her; but she
      hardly knew what could be predicated of a Baroness Münster. &ldquo;Is she&mdash;is
      she&mdash;married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix had finished his cake and wine; he got up, fixing upon the young
      girl his bright, expressive eyes. &ldquo;She is married to a German prince&mdash;Prince
      Adolf, of Silberstadt-Schreckenstein. He is not the reigning prince; he is
      a younger brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude gazed at her informant; her lips were slightly parted. &ldquo;Is she a&mdash;a
      <i>Princess</i>?&rdquo; she asked at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said the young man; &ldquo;her position is rather a singular one.
      It&rsquo;s a morganatic marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morganatic?&rdquo; These were new names and new words to poor Gertrude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they call a marriage, you know, contracted between a scion
      of a ruling house and&mdash;and a common mortal. They made Eugenia a
      Baroness, poor woman; but that was all they could do. Now they want to
      dissolve the marriage. Prince Adolf, between ourselves, is a ninny; but
      his brother, who is a clever man, has plans for him. Eugenia, naturally
      enough, makes difficulties; not, however, that I think she cares
      much&mdash;she&rsquo;s a very clever woman; I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll like
      her&mdash;but she wants to bother them. Just now everything is <i>en l&rsquo;air</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cheerful, off-hand tone in which her visitor related this darkly
      romantic tale seemed to Gertrude very strange; but it seemed also to
      convey a certain flattery to herself, a recognition of her wisdom and
      dignity. She felt a dozen impressions stirring within her, and presently
      the one that was uppermost found words. &ldquo;They want to dissolve her
      marriage?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it appears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And against her will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Against her right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must be very unhappy!&rdquo; said Gertrude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her visitor looked at her, smiling; he raised his hand to the back of his
      head and held it there a moment. &ldquo;So she says,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s her
      story. She told me to tell it you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me more,&rdquo; said Gertrude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I will leave that to her; she does it better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude gave her little excited sigh again. &ldquo;Well, if she is unhappy,&rdquo;
       she said, &ldquo;I am glad she has come to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had been so interested that she failed to notice the sound of a
      footstep in the portico; and yet it was a footstep that she always
      recognized. She heard it in the hall, and then she looked out of the
      window. They were all coming back from church&mdash;her father, her sister
      and brother, and their cousins, who always came to dinner on Sunday. Mr.
      Brand had come in first; he was in advance of the others, because,
      apparently, he was still disposed to say what she had not wished him to
      say an hour before. He came into the parlor, looking for Gertrude. He had
      two little books in his hand. On seeing Gertrude&rsquo;s companion he slowly
      stopped, looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this a cousin?&rdquo; asked Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Gertrude saw that she must introduce him; but her ears, and, by
      sympathy, her lips, were full of all that he had been telling her. &ldquo;This
      is the Prince,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the Prince of Silberstadt-Schreckenstein!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix burst out laughing, and Mr. Brand stood staring, while the others,
      who had passed into the house, appeared behind him in the open doorway.

      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      That evening at dinner Felix Young gave his sister, the Baroness Münster,
      an account of his impressions. She saw that he had come back in the
      highest possible spirits; but this fact, to her own mind, was not a reason
      for rejoicing. She had but a limited confidence in her brother&rsquo;s judgment;
      his capacity for taking rose-colored views was such as to vulgarize one of
      the prettiest of tints. Still, she supposed he could be trusted to give
      her the mere facts; and she invited him with some eagerness to communicate
      them. &ldquo;I suppose, at least, they didn&rsquo;t turn you out from the door;&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;You have been away some ten hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn me from the door!&rdquo; Felix exclaimed. &ldquo;They took me to their hearts;
      they killed the fatted calf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what you want to say: they are a collection of angels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Felix. &ldquo;They are a collection of angels&mdash;simply.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est bien vague</i>,&rdquo; remarked the Baroness. &ldquo;What are they like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like nothing you ever saw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I am much obliged; but that is hardly more definite. Seriously,
      they were glad to see you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enchanted. It has been the proudest day of my life. Never, never have I
      been so lionized! I assure you, I was cock of the walk. My dear sister,&rdquo;
       said the young man, &ldquo;<i>nous n&rsquo;avons qu&rsquo;à nous tenir</i>; we shall be great
      swells!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Münster looked at him, and her eye exhibited a slight responsive
      spark. She touched her lips to a glass of wine, and then she said,
      &ldquo;Describe them. Give me a picture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix drained his own glass. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s in the country, among the
      meadows and woods; a wild sort of place, and yet not far from here. Only,
      such a road, my dear! Imagine one of the Alpine glaciers reproduced in
      mud. But you will not spend much time on it, for they want you to come and
      stay, once for all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the Baroness, &ldquo;they want me to come and stay, once for all?
      <i>Bon</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s intensely rural, tremendously natural; and all overhung with this
      strange white light, this far-away blue sky. There&rsquo;s a big wooden house&mdash;a
      kind of three-story bungalow; it looks like a magnified Nuremberg toy.
      There was a gentleman there that made a speech to me about it and called
      it a &lsquo;venerable mansion;&rsquo; but it looks as if it had been built last
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it handsome&mdash;is it elegant?&rdquo; asked the Baroness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix looked at her a moment, smiling. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very clean! No splendors, no
      gilding, no troops of servants; rather straight-backed chairs. But you
      might eat off the floors, and you can sit down on the stairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must be a privilege. And the inhabitants are straight-backed too, of
      course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sister,&rdquo; said Felix, &ldquo;the inhabitants are charming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what style?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a style of their own. How shall I describe it? It&rsquo;s primitive; it&rsquo;s
      patriarchal; it&rsquo;s the <i>ton</i> of the golden age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have they nothing golden but their <i>ton</i>? Are there no symptoms of
      wealth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say there was wealth without symptoms. A plain, homely way of
      life: nothing for show, and very little for&mdash;what shall I call it?&mdash;for
      the senses; but a great <i>aisance</i>, and a lot of money, out of sight, that
      comes forward very quietly for subscriptions to institutions, for
      repairing tenements, for paying doctor&rsquo;s bills; perhaps even for
      portioning daughters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the daughters?&rdquo; Madame Münster demanded. &ldquo;How many are there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two, Charlotte and Gertrude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they pretty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of them,&rdquo; said Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man was silent, looking at his sister. &ldquo;Charlotte,&rdquo; he said at
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him in return. &ldquo;I see. You are in love with Gertrude. They
      must be Puritans to their finger-tips; anything but gay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, they are not gay,&rdquo; Felix admitted. &ldquo;They are sober; they are even
      severe. They are of a pensive cast; they take things hard. I think there
      is something the matter with them; they have some melancholy memory or
      some depressing expectation. It&rsquo;s not the epicurean temperament. My
      uncle, Mr. Wentworth, is a tremendously high-toned old fellow; he looks as
      if he were undergoing martyrdom, not by fire, but by freezing. But we
      shall cheer them up; we shall do them good. They will take a good deal of
      stirring up; but they are wonderfully kind and gentle. And they are
      appreciative. They think one clever; they think one remarkable!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very fine, so far as it goes,&rdquo; said the Baroness. &ldquo;But are we to
      be shut up to these three people, Mr. Wentworth and the two young women&mdash;what
      did you say their names were&mdash;Deborah and Hephzibah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; there is another little girl, a cousin of theirs, a very pretty
      creature; a thorough little American. And then there is the son of the
      house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said the Baroness. &ldquo;We are coming to the gentlemen. What of the
      son of the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid he gets tipsy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He, then, has the epicurean temperament! How old is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a boy of twenty; a pretty young fellow, but I am afraid he has
      vulgar tastes. And then there is Mr. Brand&mdash;a very tall young man, a
      sort of lay-priest. They seem to think a good deal of him, but I don&rsquo;t
      exactly make him out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is there nothing,&rdquo; asked the Baroness, &ldquo;between these extremes&mdash;this
      mysterious ecclesiastic and that intemperate youth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, there is Mr. Acton. I think,&rdquo; said the young man, with a nod at
      his sister, &ldquo;that you will like Mr. Acton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember that I am very fastidious,&rdquo; said the Baroness. &ldquo;Has he very good
      manners?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will have them with you. He is a man of the world; he has been to
      China.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Münster gave a little laugh. &ldquo;A man of the Chinese world! He must
      be very interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have an idea that he brought home a fortune,&rdquo; said Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is always interesting. Is he young, good-looking, clever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is less than forty; he has a baldish head; he says witty things. I
      rather think,&rdquo; added the young man, &ldquo;that he will admire the Baroness
      Münster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very possible,&rdquo; said this lady. Her brother never knew how she
      would take things; but shortly afterwards she declared that he had made a
      very pretty description and that on the morrow she would go and see for
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      They mounted, accordingly, into a great barouche&mdash;a vehicle as to
      which the Baroness found nothing to criticise but the price that was asked
      for it and the fact that the coachman wore a straw hat. (At Silberstadt
      Madame Münster had had liveries of yellow and crimson.) They drove into
      the country, and the Baroness, leaning far back and swaying her
      lace-fringed parasol, looked to right and to left and surveyed the
      way-side objects. After a while she pronounced them <i>affreux</i>. Her brother
      remarked that it was apparently a country in which the foreground was
      inferior to the <i>plans reculés</i>; and the Baroness rejoined that the
      landscape seemed to be all foreground. Felix had fixed with his new
      friends the hour at which he should bring his sister; it was four o&rsquo;clock
      in the afternoon. The large, clean-faced house wore, to his eyes, as the
      barouche drove up to it, a very friendly aspect; the high, slender elms
      made lengthening shadows in front of it. The Baroness descended; her
      American kinsfolk were stationed in the portico. Felix waved his hat to
      them, and a tall, lean gentleman, with a high forehead and a clean shaven
      face, came forward toward the garden gate. Charlotte Wentworth walked at
      his side. Gertrude came behind, more slowly. Both of these young ladies
      wore rustling silk dresses. Felix ushered his sister into the gate. &ldquo;Be
      very gracious,&rdquo; he said to her. But he saw the admonition was superfluous.
      Eugenia was prepared to be gracious as only Eugenia could be. Felix knew
      no keener pleasure than to be able to admire his sister unrestrictedly;
      for if the opportunity was frequent, it was not inveterate. When she
      desired to please she was to him, as to everyone else, the most charming
      woman in the world. Then he forgot that she was ever anything else; that
      she was sometimes hard and perverse; that he was occasionally afraid of
      her. Now, as she took his arm to pass into the garden, he felt that she
      desired, that she proposed, to please, and this situation made him very
      happy. Eugenia would please.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tall gentleman came to meet her, looking very rigid and grave. But it
      was a rigidity that had no illiberal meaning. Mr. Wentworth&rsquo;s manner was
      pregnant, on the contrary, with a sense of grand responsibility, of the
      solemnity of the occasion, of its being difficult to show sufficient
      deference to a lady at once so distinguished and so unhappy. Felix had
      observed on the day before his characteristic pallor; and now he perceived
      that there was something almost cadaverous in his uncle&rsquo;s high-featured
      white face. But so clever were this young man&rsquo;s quick sympathies and
      perceptions that he already learned that in these semi-mortuary
      manifestations there was no cause for alarm. His light imagination had
      gained a glimpse of Mr. Wentworth&rsquo;s spiritual mechanism, and taught him
      that, the old man being infinitely conscientious, the special operation of
      conscience within him announced itself by several of the indications of
      physical faintness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness took her uncle&rsquo;s hand, and stood looking at him with her ugly
      face and her beautiful smile. &ldquo;Have I done right to come?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very right, very right,&rdquo; said Mr. Wentworth, solemnly. He had arranged in
      his mind a little speech; but now it quite faded away. He felt almost
      frightened. He had never been looked at in just that way&mdash;with just
      that fixed, intense smile&mdash;by any woman; and it perplexed and weighed
      upon him, now, that the woman who was smiling so and who had instantly
      given him a vivid sense of her possessing other unprecedented attributes,
      was his own niece, the child of his own father&rsquo;s daughter. The idea that
      his niece should be a German Baroness, married &ldquo;morganatically&rdquo; to a
      Prince, had already given him much to think about. Was it right, was it
      just, was it acceptable? He always slept badly, and the night before he
      had lain awake much more even than usual, asking himself these questions.
      The strange word &ldquo;morganatic&rdquo; was constantly in his ears; it reminded him
      of a certain Mrs. Morgan whom he had once known and who had been a bold,
      unpleasant woman. He had a feeling that it was his duty, so long as the
      Baroness looked at him, smiling in that way, to meet her glance with his
      own scrupulously adjusted, consciously frigid organs of vision; but on
      this occasion he failed to perform his duty to the last. He looked away
      toward his daughters. &ldquo;We are very glad to see you,&rdquo; he had said. &ldquo;Allow
      me to introduce my daughters&mdash;Miss Charlotte Wentworth, Miss Gertrude
      Wentworth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness thought she had never seen people less demonstrative. But
      Charlotte kissed her and took her hand, looking at her sweetly and
      solemnly. Gertrude seemed to her almost funereal, though Gertrude might
      have found a source of gaiety in the fact that Felix, with his magnificent
      smile, had been talking to her; he had greeted her as a very old friend.
      When she kissed the Baroness she had tears in her eyes. Madame Münster
      took each of these young women by the hand, and looked at them all over.
      Charlotte thought her very strange-looking and singularly dressed; she
      could not have said whether it was well or ill. She was glad, at any rate,
      that they had put on their silk gowns&mdash;especially Gertrude. &ldquo;My
      cousins are very pretty,&rdquo; said the Baroness, turning her eyes from one to
      the other. &ldquo;Your daughters are very handsome, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charlotte blushed quickly; she had never yet heard her personal appearance
      alluded to in a loud, expressive voice. Gertrude looked away&mdash;not at
      Felix; she was extremely pleased. It was not the compliment that pleased
      her; she did not believe it; she thought herself very plain. She could
      hardly have told you the source of her satisfaction; it came from
      something in the way the Baroness spoke, and it was not diminished&mdash;it
      was rather deepened, oddly enough&mdash;by the young girl&rsquo;s disbelief. Mr.
      Wentworth was silent; and then he asked, formally, &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come into
      the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are not all; you have some other children,&rdquo; said the Baroness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a son,&rdquo; Mr. Wentworth answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why doesn&rsquo;t he come to meet me?&rdquo; Eugenia cried. &ldquo;I am afraid he is
      not so charming as his sisters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; I will see about it,&rdquo; the old man declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is rather afraid of ladies,&rdquo; Charlotte said, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very handsome,&rdquo; said Gertrude, as loud as she could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will go in and find him. We will draw him out of his <i>cachette</i>.&rdquo; And
      the Baroness took Mr. Wentworth&rsquo;s arm, who was not aware that he had
      offered it to her, and who, as they walked toward the house, wondered
      whether he ought to have offered it and whether it was proper for her to
      take it if it had not been offered. &ldquo;I want to know you well,&rdquo; said the
      Baroness, interrupting these meditations, &ldquo;and I want you to know me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems natural that we should know each other,&rdquo; Mr. Wentworth rejoined.
      &ldquo;We are near relatives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, there comes a moment in life when one reverts, irresistibly, to one&rsquo;s
      natural ties&mdash;to one&rsquo;s natural affections. You must have found that!&rdquo;
       said Eugenia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wentworth had been told the day before by Felix that Eugenia was very
      clever, very brilliant, and the information had held him in some suspense.
      This was the cleverness, he supposed; the brilliancy was beginning. &ldquo;Yes,
      the natural affections are very strong,&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In some people,&rdquo; the Baroness declared. &ldquo;Not in all.&rdquo; Charlotte was
      walking beside her; she took hold of her hand again, smiling always. &ldquo;And
      you, <i>cousine</i>, where did you get that enchanting complexion?&rdquo; she went on;
      &ldquo;such lilies and roses?&rdquo; The roses in poor Charlotte&rsquo;s countenance began
      speedily to predominate over the lilies, and she quickened her step and
      reached the portico. &ldquo;This is the country of complexions,&rdquo; the Baroness
      continued, addressing herself to Mr. Wentworth. &ldquo;I am convinced they are
      more delicate. There are very good ones in England&mdash;in Holland; but
      they are very apt to be coarse. There is too much red.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you will find,&rdquo; said Mr. Wentworth, &ldquo;that this country is
      superior in many respects to those you mention. I have been to England and
      Holland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you have been to Europe?&rdquo; cried the Baroness. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come
      and see me? But it&rsquo;s better, after all, this way,&rdquo; she said. They were
      entering the house; she paused and looked round her. &ldquo;I see you have
      arranged your house&mdash;your beautiful house&mdash;in the&mdash;in the
      Dutch taste!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The house is very old,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Wentworth. &ldquo;General Washington once
      spent a week here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I have heard of Washington,&rdquo; cried the Baroness. &ldquo;My father used to
      tell me of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wentworth was silent a moment, and then, &ldquo;I found he was very well
      known in Europe,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix had lingered in the garden with Gertrude; he was standing before her
      and smiling, as he had done the day before. What had happened the day
      before seemed to her a kind of dream. He had been there and he had changed
      everything; the others had seen him, they had talked with him; but that he
      should come again, that he should be part of the future, part of her
      small, familiar, much-meditating life&mdash;this needed, afresh, the
      evidence of her senses. The evidence had come to her senses now; and her
      senses seemed to rejoice in it. &ldquo;What do you think of Eugenia?&rdquo; Felix
      asked. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she charming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is very brilliant,&rdquo; said Gertrude. &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t tell yet. She seems
      to me like a singer singing an air. You can&rsquo;t tell till the song is done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, the song will never be done!&rdquo; exclaimed the young man, laughing.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think her handsome?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude had been disappointed in the beauty of the Baroness Münster; she
      had expected her, for mysterious reasons, to resemble a very pretty
      portrait of the Empress Josephine, of which there hung an engraving in one
      of the parlors, and which the younger Miss Wentworth had always greatly
      admired. But the Baroness was not at all like that&mdash;not at all.
      Though different, however, she was very wonderful, and Gertrude felt
      herself most suggestively corrected. It was strange, nevertheless, that
      Felix should speak in that positive way about his sister&rsquo;s beauty. &ldquo;I
      think I <i>shall</i> think her handsome,&rdquo; Gertrude said. &ldquo;It must be very
      interesting to know her. I don&rsquo;t feel as if I ever could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you will know her well; you will become great friends,&rdquo; Felix
      declared, as if this were the easiest thing in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is very graceful,&rdquo; said Gertrude, looking after the Baroness,
      suspended to her father&rsquo;s arm. It was a pleasure to her to say that
      anyone was graceful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix had been looking about him. &ldquo;And your little cousin, of yesterday,&rdquo;
       he said, &ldquo;who was so wonderfully pretty&mdash;what has become of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is in the parlor,&rdquo; Gertrude answered. &ldquo;Yes, she is very pretty.&rdquo; She
      felt as if it were her duty to take him straight into the house, to where
      he might be near her cousin. But after hesitating a moment she lingered
      still. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t believe you would come back,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not come back!&rdquo; cried Felix, laughing. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know, then, the
      impression made upon this susceptible heart of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wondered whether he meant the impression her cousin Lizzie had made.
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think we should ever see you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray what did you think would become of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I thought you would melt away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a compliment to my solidity! I melt very often,&rdquo; said Felix, &ldquo;but
      there is always something left of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came and waited for you by the door, because the others did,&rdquo; Gertrude
      went on. &ldquo;But if you had never appeared I should not have been surprised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; declared Felix, looking at her, &ldquo;that you would have been
      disappointed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him a little, and shook her head. &ldquo;No&mdash;no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Ah, par exemple!&rdquo;</i> cried the young man. &ldquo;You deserve that I should never
      leave you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Going into the parlor they found Mr. Wentworth performing introductions. A
      young man was standing before the Baroness, blushing a good deal, laughing
      a little, and shifting his weight from one foot to the other&mdash;a slim,
      mild-faced young man, with neatly-arranged features, like those of Mr.
      Wentworth. Two other gentlemen, behind him, had risen from their seats,
      and a little apart, near one of the windows, stood a remarkably pretty
      young girl. The young girl was knitting a stocking; but, while her fingers
      quickly moved, she looked with wide, brilliant eyes at the Baroness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is your son&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; said Eugenia, smiling at the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Clifford Wentworth, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he said in a tremulous voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come out to meet me, Mr. Clifford Wentworth?&rdquo; the
      Baroness demanded, with her beautiful smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you would want me,&rdquo; said the young man, slowly sidling
      about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One always wants a <i>beau cousin</i>,&mdash;if one has one! But if you are very
      nice to me in future I won&rsquo;t remember it against you.&rdquo; And Madame Münster transferred her smile to the other persons present. It rested
      first upon the candid countenance and long-skirted figure of Mr. Brand,
      whose eyes were intently fixed upon Mr. Wentworth, as if to beg him not to
      prolong an anomalous situation. Mr. Wentworth pronounced his name. Eugenia
      gave him a very charming glance, and then looked at the other gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      This latter personage was a man of rather less than the usual stature and
      the usual weight, with a quick, observant, agreeable dark eye, a small
      quantity of thin dark hair, and a small moustache. He had been standing
      with his hands in his pockets; and when Eugenia looked at him he took them
      out. But he did not, like Mr. Brand, look evasively and urgently at their
      host. He met Eugenia&rsquo;s eyes; he appeared to appreciate the privilege of
      meeting them. Madame Münster instantly felt that he was, intrinsically,
      the most important person present. She was not unconscious that this
      impression was in some degree manifested in the little sympathetic nod
      with which she acknowledged Mr. Wentworth&rsquo;s announcement, &ldquo;My cousin, Mr.
      Acton!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your cousin&mdash;not mine?&rdquo; said the Baroness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It only depends upon you,&rdquo; Mr. Acton declared, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness looked at him a moment, and noticed that he had very white
      teeth. &ldquo;Let it depend upon your behavior,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think I had better
      wait. I have cousins enough. Unless I can also claim relationship,&rdquo; she
      added, &ldquo;with that charming young lady,&rdquo; and she pointed to the young girl
      at the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my sister,&rdquo; said Mr. Acton. And Gertrude Wentworth put her arm
      round the young girl and led her forward. It was not, apparently, that she
      needed much leading. She came toward the Baroness with a light, quick
      step, and with perfect self-possession, rolling her stocking round its
      needles. She had dark blue eyes and dark brown hair; she was wonderfully
      pretty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eugenia kissed her, as she had kissed the other young women, and then held
      her off a little, looking at her. &ldquo;Now this is quite another <i>type</i>,&rdquo; she
      said; she pronounced the word in the French manner. &ldquo;This is a different
      outline, my uncle, a different character, from that of your own daughters.
      This, Felix,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;is very much more what we have always thought
      of as the American type.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young girl, during this exposition, was smiling askance at everyone
      in turn, and at Felix out of turn. &ldquo;I find only one type here!&rdquo; cried
      Felix, laughing. &ldquo;The type adorable!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This sally was received in perfect silence, but Felix, who learned all
      things quickly, had already learned that the silences frequently observed
      among his new acquaintances were not necessarily restrictive or resentful.
      It was, as one might say, the silence of expectation, of modesty. They
      were all standing round his sister, as if they were expecting her to
      acquit herself of the exhibition of some peculiar faculty, some brilliant
      talent. Their attitude seemed to imply that she was a kind of
      conversational mountebank, attired, intellectually, in gauze and spangles.
      This attitude gave a certain ironical force to Madame Münster&rsquo;s next
      words. &ldquo;Now this is your circle,&rdquo; she said to her uncle. &ldquo;This is your
      <i>salon</i>. These are your regular <i>habitués</i>, eh? I am so glad to see you
      all together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Mr. Wentworth, &ldquo;they are always dropping in and out. You must
      do the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; interposed Charlotte Wentworth, &ldquo;they must do something more.&rdquo;
       And she turned her sweet, serious face, that seemed at once timid and
      placid, upon their interesting visitor. &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eugenia-Camilla-Dolores,&rdquo; said the Baroness, smiling. &ldquo;But you needn&rsquo;t
      say all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will say Eugenia, if you will let me. You must come and stay with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness laid her hand upon Charlotte&rsquo;s arm very tenderly; but she
      reserved herself. She was wondering whether it would be possible to &ldquo;stay&rdquo;
       with these people. &ldquo;It would be very charming&mdash;very charming,&rdquo; she
      said; and her eyes wandered over the company, over the room. She wished to
      gain time before committing herself. Her glance fell upon young Mr. Brand,
      who stood there, with his arms folded and his hand on his chin, looking at
      her. &ldquo;The gentleman, I suppose, is a sort of ecclesiastic,&rdquo; she said to
      Mr. Wentworth, lowering her voice a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a minister,&rdquo; answered Mr. Wentworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Protestant?&rdquo; asked Eugenia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a Unitarian, madam,&rdquo; replied Mr. Brand, impressively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I see,&rdquo; said Eugenia. &ldquo;Something new.&rdquo; She had never heard of this
      form of worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Acton began to laugh, and Gertrude looked anxiously at Mr. Brand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have come very far,&rdquo; said Mr. Wentworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very far&mdash;very far,&rdquo; the Baroness replied, with a graceful shake of
      her head&mdash;a shake that might have meant many different things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a reason why you ought to settle down with us,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Wentworth, with that dryness of utterance which, as Eugenia was too
      intelligent not to feel, took nothing from the delicacy of his meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him, and for an instant, in his cold, still face, she seemed
      to see a far-away likeness to the vaguely remembered image of her mother.
      Eugenia was a woman of sudden emotions, and now, unexpectedly, she felt
      one rising in her heart. She kept looking round the circle; she knew that
      there was admiration in all the eyes that were fixed upon her. She smiled
      at them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to look&mdash;to try&mdash;to ask,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It seems to me I
      have done well. I am very tired; I want to rest.&rdquo; There were tears in her
      eyes. The luminous interior, the gentle, tranquil people, the simple,
      serious life&mdash;the sense of these things pressed upon her with an
      overmastering force, and she felt herself yielding to one of the most
      genuine emotions she had ever known. &ldquo;I should like to stay here,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;Pray take me in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though she was smiling, there were tears in her voice as well as in her
      eyes. &ldquo;My dear niece,&rdquo; said Mr. Wentworth, softly. And Charlotte put out
      her arms and drew the Baroness toward her; while Robert Acton turned away,
      with his hands stealing into his pockets.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      A few days after the Baroness Münster had presented herself to her
      American kinsfolk she came, with her brother, and took up her abode in
      that small white house adjacent to Mr. Wentworth&rsquo;s own dwelling of which
      mention has already been made. It was on going with his daughters to
      return her visit that Mr. Wentworth placed this comfortable cottage at her
      service; the offer being the result of a domestic colloquy, diffused
      through the ensuing twenty-four hours, in the course of which the two
      foreign visitors were discussed and analyzed with a great deal of
      earnestness and subtlety. The discussion went forward, as I say, in the
      family circle; but that circle on the evening following Madame Münster&rsquo;s
      return to town, as on many other occasions, included Robert
      Acton and his pretty sister. If you had been present, it would probably
      not have seemed to you that the advent of these brilliant strangers was
      treated as an exhilarating occurrence, a pleasure the more in this
      tranquil household, a prospective source of entertainment. This was not
      Mr. Wentworth&rsquo;s way of treating any human occurrence. The sudden irruption
      into the well-ordered consciousness of the Wentworths of an element not
      allowed for in its scheme of usual obligations required a readjustment of
      that sense of responsibility which constituted its principal furniture. To
      consider an event, crudely and baldly, in the light of the pleasure it
      might bring them was an intellectual exercise with which Felix Young&rsquo;s
      American cousins were almost wholly unacquainted, and which they scarcely
      supposed to be largely pursued in any section of human society. The
      arrival of Felix and his sister was a satisfaction, but it was a
      singularly joyless and inelastic satisfaction. It was an extension of
      duty, of the exercise of the more recondite virtues; but neither Mr.
      Wentworth, nor Charlotte, nor Mr. Brand, who, among these excellent
      people, was a great promoter of reflection and aspiration, frankly
      adverted to it as an extension of enjoyment. This function was ultimately
      assumed by Gertrude Wentworth, who was a peculiar girl, but the full
      compass of whose peculiarities had not been exhibited before they very
      ingeniously found their pretext in the presence of these possibly too
      agreeable foreigners. Gertrude, however, had to struggle with a great
      accumulation of obstructions, both of the subjective, as the
      metaphysicians say, and of the objective, order; and indeed it is no small
      part of the purpose of this little history to set forth her struggle. What
      seemed paramount in this abrupt enlargement of Mr. Wentworth&rsquo;s sympathies
      and those of his daughters was an extension of the field of possible
      mistakes; and the doctrine, as it may almost be called, of the oppressive
      gravity of mistakes was one of the most cherished traditions of the
      Wentworth family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe she wants to come and stay in this house,&rdquo; said Gertrude;
      Madame Münster, from this time forward, receiving no other designation
      than the personal pronoun. Charlotte and Gertrude acquired considerable
      facility in addressing her, directly, as &ldquo;Eugenia;&rdquo; but in speaking of her
      to each other they rarely called her anything but &ldquo;she.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t she think it good enough for her?&rdquo; cried little Lizzie Acton,
      who was always asking unpractical questions that required, in strictness,
      no answer, and to which indeed she expected no other answer than such as
      she herself invariably furnished in a small, innocently-satirical laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She certainly expressed a willingness to come,&rdquo; said Mr. Wentworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was only politeness,&rdquo; Gertrude rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she is very polite&mdash;very polite,&rdquo; said Mr. Wentworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is too polite,&rdquo; his son declared, in a softly growling tone which was
      habitual to him, but which was an indication of nothing worse than a
      vaguely humorous intention. &ldquo;It is very embarrassing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is more than can be said of you, sir,&rdquo; said Lizzie Acton, with her
      little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t mean to encourage her,&rdquo; Clifford went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t care if you do!&rdquo; cried Lizzie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will not think of you, Clifford,&rdquo; said Gertrude, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not!&rdquo; Clifford exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will think of Robert,&rdquo; Gertrude continued, in the same tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert Acton began to blush; but there was no occasion for it, for everyone
      was looking at Gertrude&mdash;everyone, at least, save Lizzie, who,
      with her pretty head on one side, contemplated her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you attribute motives, Gertrude?&rdquo; asked Mr. Wentworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t attribute motives, father,&rdquo; said Gertrude. &ldquo;I only say she will
      think of Robert; and she will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gertrude judges by herself!&rdquo; Acton exclaimed, laughing. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you,
      Gertrude? Of course the Baroness will think of me. She will think of me
      from morning till night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will be very comfortable here,&rdquo; said Charlotte, with something of a
      housewife&rsquo;s pride. &ldquo;She can have the large northeast room. And the French
      bedstead,&rdquo; Charlotte added, with a constant sense of the lady&rsquo;s
      foreignness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will not like it,&rdquo; said Gertrude; &ldquo;not even if you pin little tidies
      all over the chairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, dear?&rdquo; asked Charlotte, perceiving a touch of irony here, but
      not resenting it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude had left her chair; she was walking about the room; her stiff
      silk dress, which she had put on in honor of the Baroness, made a sound
      upon the carpet. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;She will want something
      more&mdash;more private.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she wants to be private she can stay in her room,&rdquo; Lizzie Acton
      remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude paused in her walk, looking at her. &ldquo;That would not be pleasant,&rdquo;
       she answered. &ldquo;She wants privacy and pleasure together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Robert Acton began to laugh again. &ldquo;My dear cousin, what a picture!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charlotte had fixed her serious eyes upon her sister; she wondered whence
      she had suddenly derived these strange notions. Mr. Wentworth also
      observed his younger daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what her manner of life may have been,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but she
      certainly never can have enjoyed a more refined and salubrious home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude stood there looking at them all. &ldquo;She is the wife of a Prince,&rdquo;
       she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are all princes here,&rdquo; said Mr. Wentworth; &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t know of any
      palace in this neighborhood that is to let.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cousin William,&rdquo; Robert Acton interposed, &ldquo;do you want to do something
      handsome? Make them a present, for three months, of the little house over
      the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very generous with other people&rsquo;s things!&rdquo; cried his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robert is very generous with his own things,&rdquo; Mr. Wentworth observed
      dispassionately, and looking, in cold meditation, at his kinsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gertrude,&rdquo; Lizzie went on, &ldquo;I had an idea you were so fond of your new
      cousin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which new cousin?&rdquo; asked Gertrude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean the Baroness!&rdquo; the young girl rejoined, with her laugh. &ldquo;I
      thought you expected to see so much of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of Felix? I hope to see a great deal of him,&rdquo; said Gertrude, simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why do you want to keep him out of the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude looked at Lizzie Acton, and then looked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should you want me to live in the house with you, Lizzie?&rdquo; asked
      Clifford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you never will. I hate you!&rdquo; Such was this young lady&rsquo;s reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Gertrude, stopping before Mr. Wentworth and smiling, with a
      smile the sweeter, as her smile always was, for its rarity; &ldquo;do let them
      live in the little house over the way. It will be lovely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Robert Acton had been watching her. &ldquo;Gertrude is right,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;Gertrude is the cleverest girl in the world. If I might take the liberty,
      I should strongly recommend their living there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing there so pretty as the northeast room,&rdquo; Charlotte urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will make it pretty. Leave her alone!&rdquo; Acton exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude, at his compliment, had blushed and looked at him: it was as if
      someone less familiar had complimented her. &ldquo;I am sure she will make it
      pretty. It will be very interesting. It will be a place to go to. It will
      be a foreign house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we very sure that we need a foreign house?&rdquo; Mr. Wentworth inquired.
      &ldquo;Do you think it desirable to establish a foreign house&mdash;in this
      quiet place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak,&rdquo; said Acton, laughing, &ldquo;as if it were a question of the poor
      Baroness opening a wine-shop or a gaming-table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be too lovely!&rdquo; Gertrude declared again, laying her hand on the
      back of her father&rsquo;s chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That she should open a gaming-table?&rdquo; Charlotte asked, with great
      gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude looked at her a moment, and then, &ldquo;Yes, Charlotte,&rdquo; she said,
      simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gertrude is growing pert,&rdquo; Clifford Wentworth observed, with his humorous
      young growl. &ldquo;That comes of associating with foreigners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wentworth looked up at his daughter, who was standing beside him; he
      drew her gently forward. &ldquo;You must be careful,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You must keep
      watch. Indeed, we must all be careful. This is a great change; we are to
      be exposed to peculiar influences. I don&rsquo;t say they are bad. I don&rsquo;t judge
      them in advance. But they may perhaps make it necessary that we should
      exercise a great deal of wisdom and self-control. It will be a different
      tone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude was silent a moment, in deference to her father&rsquo;s speech; then
      she spoke in a manner that was not in the least an answer to it. &ldquo;I want
      to see how they will live. I am sure they will have different hours. She
      will do all kinds of little things differently. When we go over there it
      will be like going to Europe. She will have a boudoir. She will invite us
      to dinner&mdash;very late. She will breakfast in her room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charlotte gazed at her sister again. Gertrude&rsquo;s imagination seemed to her
      to be fairly running riot. She had always known that Gertrude had a great
      deal of imagination&mdash;she had been very proud of it. But at the same
      time she had always felt that it was a dangerous and irresponsible
      faculty; and now, to her sense, for the moment, it seemed to threaten to
      make her sister a strange person who should come in suddenly, as from a
      journey, talking of the peculiar and possibly unpleasant things she had
      observed. Charlotte&rsquo;s imagination took no journeys whatever; she kept it,
      as it were, in her pocket, with the other furniture of this receptacle&mdash;a
      thimble, a little box of peppermint, and a morsel of court-plaster. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t believe she would have any dinner&mdash;or any breakfast,&rdquo; said Miss
      Wentworth. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe she knows how to do anything herself. I should
      have to get her ever so many servants, and she wouldn&rsquo;t like them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has a maid,&rdquo; said Gertrude; &ldquo;a French maid. She mentioned her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if the maid has a little fluted cap and red slippers,&rdquo; said
      Lizzie Acton. &ldquo;There was a French maid in that play that Robert took me to
      see. She had pink stockings; she was very wicked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was a <i>soubrette</i>,&rdquo; Gertrude announced, who had never seen a play in
      her life. &ldquo;They call that a soubrette. It will be a great chance to learn
      French.&rdquo; Charlotte gave a little soft, helpless groan. She had a vision of
      a wicked, theatrical person, clad in pink stockings and red shoes, and
      speaking, with confounding volubility, an incomprehensible tongue,
      flitting through the sacred penetralia of that large, clean house. &ldquo;That
      is one reason in favor of their coming here,&rdquo; Gertrude went on. &ldquo;But we
      can make Eugenia speak French to us, and Felix. I mean to begin&mdash;the
      next time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wentworth had kept her standing near him, and he gave her his earnest,
      thin, unresponsive glance again. &ldquo;I want you to make me a promise,
      Gertrude,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to get excited. Not to allow these&mdash;these occurrences to be an
      occasion for excitement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked down at him a moment, and then she shook her head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      think I can promise that, father. I am excited already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wentworth was silent a while; they all were silent, as if in
      recognition of something audacious and portentous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think they had better go to the other house,&rdquo; said Charlotte, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall keep them in the other house,&rdquo; Mr. Wentworth subjoined, more
      pregnantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude turned away; then she looked across at Robert Acton. Her cousin
      Robert was a great friend of hers; she often looked at him this way
      instead of saying things. Her glance on this occasion, however, struck him
      as a substitute for a larger volume of diffident utterance than usual,
      inviting him to observe, among other things, the inefficiency of her
      father&rsquo;s design&mdash;if design it was&mdash;for diminishing, in the
      interest of quiet nerves, their occasions of contact with their foreign
      relatives. But Acton immediately complimented Mr. Wentworth upon his
      liberality. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very nice thing to do,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;giving them the
      little house. You will have treated them handsomely, and, whatever
      happens, you will be glad of it.&rdquo; Mr. Wentworth was liberal, and he knew
      he was liberal. It gave him pleasure to know it, to feel it, to see it
      recorded; and this pleasure is the only palpable form of self-indulgence
      with which the narrator of these incidents will be able to charge him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A three days&rsquo; visit at most, over there, is all I should have found
      possible,&rdquo; Madame Münster remarked to her brother, after they had taken
      possession of the little white house. &ldquo;It would have been too
      <i>intime</i>&mdash;decidedly too <i>intime</i>. Breakfast, dinner, and
      tea <i>en famille</i>&mdash;it would have been
      the end of the world if I could have reached the third day.&rdquo; And she made
      the same observation to her maid Augustine, an intelligent person, who
      enjoyed a liberal share of her confidence. Felix declared that he would
      willingly spend his life in the bosom of the Wentworth family; that they
      were the kindest, simplest, most amiable people in the world, and that he
      had taken a prodigious fancy to them all. The Baroness quite agreed with
      him that they were simple and kind; they were thoroughly nice people, and
      she liked them extremely. The girls were perfect ladies; it was impossible
      to be more of a lady than Charlotte Wentworth, in spite of her little
      village air. &ldquo;But as for thinking them the best company in the world,&rdquo;
       said the Baroness, &ldquo;that is another thing; and as for wishing to live
      <i>porte à porte</i> with them, I should as soon think of wishing myself back in
      the convent again, to wear a bombazine apron and sleep in a dormitory.&rdquo;
       And yet the Baroness was in high good humor; she had been very much
      pleased. With her lively perception and her refined imagination, she was
      capable of enjoying anything that was characteristic, anything that was
      good of its kind. The Wentworth household seemed to her very perfect in
      its kind&mdash;wonderfully peaceful and unspotted; pervaded by a sort of
      dove-colored freshness that had all the quietude and benevolence of what
      she deemed to be Quakerism, and yet seemed to be founded upon a degree of
      material abundance for which, in certain matters of detail, one might have
      looked in vain at the frugal little court of Silberstadt-Schreckenstein.
      She perceived immediately that her American relatives thought and talked
      very little about money; and this of itself made an impression upon
      Eugenia&rsquo;s imagination. She perceived at the same time that if Charlotte or
      Gertrude should ask their father for a very considerable sum he would at
      once place it in their hands; and this made a still greater impression.
      The greatest impression of all, perhaps, was made by another rapid
      induction. The Baroness had an immediate conviction that Robert Acton
      would put his hand into his pocket every day in the week if that
      rattle-pated little sister of his should bid him. The men in this country,
      said the Baroness, are evidently very obliging. Her declaration that she
      was looking for rest and retirement had been by no means wholly untrue;
      nothing that the Baroness said was wholly untrue. It is but fair to add,
      perhaps, that nothing that she said was wholly true. She wrote to a friend
      in Germany that it was a return to nature; it was like drinking new milk,
      and she was very fond of new milk. She said to herself, of course, that it
      would be a little dull; but there can be no better proof of her good
      spirits than the fact that she thought she should not mind its being a
      little dull. It seemed to her, when from the piazza of her eleemosynary
      cottage she looked out over the soundless fields, the stony pastures, the
      clear-faced ponds, the rugged little orchards, that she had never been in
      the midst of so peculiarly intense a stillness; it was almost a delicate
      sensual pleasure. It was all very good, very innocent and safe, and out of
      it something good must come. Augustine, indeed, who had an unbounded faith
      in her mistress&rsquo;s wisdom and far-sightedness, was a great deal perplexed
      and depressed. She was always ready to take her cue when she understood
      it; but she liked to understand it, and on this occasion comprehension
      failed. What, indeed, was the Baroness doing <i>dans cette galère</i>? what fish
      did she expect to land out of these very stagnant waters? The game was
      evidently a deep one. Augustine could trust her; but the sense of walking
      in the dark betrayed itself in the physiognomy of this spare, sober,
      sallow, middle-aged person, who had nothing in common with Gertrude
      Wentworth&rsquo;s conception of a soubrette, by the most ironical scowl that had
      ever rested upon the unpretending tokens of the peace and plenty of the
      Wentworths. Fortunately, Augustine could quench skepticism in action. She
      quite agreed with her mistress&mdash;or rather she quite out-stripped her
      mistress&mdash;in thinking that the little white house was pitifully bare.
      <i>&ldquo;Il faudra,&rdquo;</i> said Augustine, <i>&ldquo;lui faire un peu de toilette.&rdquo;</i> And she began
      to hang up <i>portières</i> in the doorways; to place wax candles, procured after
      some research, in unexpected situations; to dispose anomalous draperies
      over the arms of sofas and the backs of chairs. The Baroness had brought
      with her to the New World a copious provision of the element of costume;
      and the two Miss Wentworths, when they came over to see her, were somewhat
      bewildered by the obtrusive distribution of her wardrobe. There were India
      shawls suspended, curtain-wise, in the parlor door, and curious fabrics,
      corresponding to Gertrude&rsquo;s metaphysical vision of an opera-cloak, tumbled
      about in the sitting-places. There were pink silk blinds in the windows,
      by which the room was strangely bedimmed; and along the chimney-piece was
      disposed a remarkable band of velvet, covered with coarse, dirty-looking
      lace. &ldquo;I have been making myself a little comfortable,&rdquo; said the Baroness,
      much to the confusion of Charlotte, who had been on the point of proposing
      to come and help her put her superfluous draperies away. But what
      Charlotte mistook for an almost culpably delayed subsidence Gertrude very
      presently perceived to be the most ingenious, the most interesting, the
      most romantic intention. &ldquo;What is life, indeed, without curtains?&rdquo; she
      secretly asked herself; and she appeared to herself to have been leading
      hitherto an existence singularly garish and totally devoid of festoons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix was not a young man who troubled himself greatly about anything&mdash;least
      of all about the conditions of enjoyment. His faculty of enjoyment was so
      large, so unconsciously eager, that it may be said of it that it had a
      permanent advance upon embarrassment and sorrow. His sentient faculty was
      intrinsically joyous, and novelty and change were in themselves a delight
      to him. As they had come to him with a great deal of frequency, his life
      had been more agreeable than appeared. Never was a nature more perfectly
      fortunate. It was not a restless, apprehensive, ambitious spirit, running
      a race with the tyranny of fate, but a temper so unsuspicious as to put
      Adversity off her guard, dodging and evading her with the easy, natural
      motion of a wind-shifted flower. Felix extracted entertainment from all
      things, and all his faculties&mdash;his imagination, his intelligence, his
      affections, his senses&mdash;had a hand in the game. It seemed to him that
      Eugenia and he had been very well treated; there was something absolutely
      touching in that combination of paternal liberality and social
      considerateness which marked Mr. Wentworth&rsquo;s deportment. It was most
      uncommonly kind of him, for instance, to have given them a house. Felix
      was positively amused at having a house of his own; for the little white
      cottage among the apple trees&mdash;the chalet, as Madame Münster always
      called it&mdash;was much more sensibly his own than any domiciliary
      <i>quatrième</i>, looking upon a court, with the rent overdue. Felix had spent a
      good deal of his life in looking into courts, with a perhaps slightly
      tattered pair of elbows resting upon the ledge of a high-perched window,
      and the thin smoke of a cigarette rising into an atmosphere in which
      street-cries died away and the vibration of chimes from ancient belfries
      became sensible. He had never known anything so infinitely rural as these
      New England fields; and he took a great fancy to all their pastoral
      roughnesses. He had never had a greater sense of luxurious security; and
      at the risk of making him seem a rather sordid adventurer I must declare
      that he found an irresistible charm in the fact that he might dine every
      day at his uncle&rsquo;s. The charm was irresistible, however, because his fancy
      flung a rosy light over this homely privilege. He appreciated highly the
      fare that was set before him. There was a kind of fresh-looking abundance
      about it which made him think that people must have lived so in the
      mythological era, when they spread their tables upon the grass,
      replenished them from cornucopias, and had no particular need of kitchen
      stoves. But the great thing that Felix enjoyed was having found a family&mdash;sitting
      in the midst of gentle, generous people whom he might call by their first
      names. He had never known anything more charming than the attention they
      paid to what he said. It was like a large sheet of clean, fine-grained
      drawing-paper, all ready to be washed over with effective splashes of
      water-color. He had never had any cousins, and he had never before found
      himself in contact so unrestricted with young unmarried ladies. He was
      extremely fond of the society of ladies, and it was new to him that it
      might be enjoyed in just this manner. At first he hardly knew what to make
      of his state of mind. It seemed to him that he was in love,
      indiscriminately, with three girls at once. He saw that Lizzie Acton was
      more brilliantly pretty than Charlotte and Gertrude; but this was scarcely
      a superiority. His pleasure came from something they had in common&mdash;a
      part of which was, indeed, that physical delicacy which seemed to make it
      proper that they should always dress in thin materials and clear colors.
      But they were delicate in other ways, and it was most agreeable to him to
      feel that these latter delicacies were appreciable by contact, as it were.
      He had known, fortunately, many virtuous gentlewomen, but it now appeared
      to him that in his relations with them (especially when they were
      unmarried) he had been looking at pictures under glass. He perceived at
      present what a nuisance the glass had been&mdash;how it perverted and
      interfered, how it caught the reflection of other objects and kept you
      walking from side to side. He had no need to ask himself whether Charlotte
      and Gertrude, and Lizzie Acton, were in the right light; they were always
      in the right light. He liked everything about them: he was, for instance,
      not at all above liking the fact that they had very slender feet and high
      insteps. He liked their pretty noses; he liked their surprised eyes and
      their hesitating, not at all positive way of speaking; he liked so much
      knowing that he was perfectly at liberty to be alone for hours, anywhere,
      with either of them; that preference for one to the other, as a companion
      of solitude, remained a minor affair. Charlotte Wentworth&rsquo;s sweetly severe
      features were as agreeable as Lizzie Acton&rsquo;s wonderfully expressive blue
      eyes; and Gertrude&rsquo;s air of being always ready to walk about and listen
      was as charming as anything else, especially as she walked very
      gracefully. After a while Felix began to distinguish; but even then he
      would often wish, suddenly, that they were not all so sad. Even Lizzie
      Acton, in spite of her fine little chatter and laughter, appeared sad.
      Even Clifford Wentworth, who had extreme youth in his favor, and kept a
      buggy with enormous wheels and a little sorrel mare with the prettiest
      legs in the world&mdash;even this fortunate lad was apt to have an
      averted, uncomfortable glance, and to edge away from you at times, in the
      manner of a person with a bad conscience. The only person in the circle
      with no sense of oppression of any kind was, to Felix&rsquo;s perception, Robert
      Acton.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might perhaps have been feared that after the completion of those
      graceful domiciliary embellishments which have been mentioned Madame Münster
      would have found herself confronted with alarming possibilities
      of <i>ennui</i>. But as yet she had not taken the alarm. The Baroness was a
      restless soul, and she projected her restlessness, as it may be said, into
      any situation that lay before her. Up to a certain point her restlessness
      might be counted upon to entertain her. She was always expecting something
      to happen, and, until it was disappointed, expectancy itself was a
      delicate pleasure. What the Baroness expected just now it would take some
      ingenuity to set forth; it is enough that while she looked about her she
      found something to occupy her imagination. She assured herself that she
      was enchanted with her new relatives; she professed to herself that, like
      her brother, she felt it a sacred satisfaction to have found a family. It
      is certain that she enjoyed to the utmost the gentleness of her kinsfolk&rsquo;s
      deference. She had, first and last, received a great deal of admiration,
      and her experience of well-turned compliments was very considerable; but
      she knew that she had never been so real a power, never counted for so
      much, as now when, for the first time, the standard of comparison of her
      little circle was a prey to vagueness. The sense, indeed, that the good
      people about her had, as regards her remarkable self, no standard of
      comparison at all gave her a feeling of almost illimitable power. It was
      true, as she said to herself, that if for this reason they would be able
      to discover nothing against her, so they would perhaps neglect to perceive
      some of her superior points; but she always wound up her reflections by
      declaring that she would take care of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charlotte and Gertrude were in some perplexity between their desire to
      show all proper attention to Madame Münster and their fear of being
      importunate. The little house in the orchard had hitherto been occupied
      during the summer months by intimate friends of the family, or by poor
      relations who found in Mr. Wentworth a landlord attentive to repairs and
      oblivious of quarter-day. Under these circumstances the open door of the
      small house and that of the large one, facing each other across their
      homely gardens, levied no tax upon hourly visits. But the Misses Wentworth
      received an impression that Eugenia was no friend to the primitive custom
      of &ldquo;dropping in;&rdquo; she evidently had no idea of living without a
      door-keeper. &ldquo;One goes into your house as into an inn&mdash;except that
      there are no servants rushing forward,&rdquo; she said to Charlotte. And she
      added that that was very charming. Gertrude explained to her sister that
      she meant just the reverse; she didn&rsquo;t like it at all. Charlotte inquired
      why she should tell an untruth, and Gertrude answered that there was
      probably some very good reason for it which they should discover when they
      knew her better. &ldquo;There can surely be no good reason for telling an
      untruth,&rdquo; said Charlotte. &ldquo;I hope she does not think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had of course desired, from the first, to do everything in the way of
      helping her to arrange herself. It had seemed to Charlotte that there
      would be a great many things to talk about; but the Baroness was
      apparently inclined to talk about nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write her a note, asking her leave to come and see her. I think that is
      what she will like,&rdquo; said Gertrude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I give her the trouble of answering me?&rdquo; Charlotte asked. &ldquo;She
      will have to write a note and send it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she will take any trouble,&rdquo; said Gertrude, profoundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then will she do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I am curious to see,&rdquo; said Gertrude, leaving her sister with
      an impression that her curiosity was morbid.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went to see the Baroness without preliminary correspondence; and in
      the little salon which she had already created, with its becoming light
      and its festoons, they found Robert Acton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eugenia was intensely gracious, but she accused them of neglecting her
      cruelly. &ldquo;You see Mr. Acton has had to take pity upon me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My
      brother goes off sketching, for hours; I can never depend upon him. So I
      was to send Mr. Acton to beg you to come and give me the benefit of your
      wisdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude looked at her sister. She wanted to say, &ldquo;<i>That</i> is what she would
      have done.&rdquo; Charlotte said that they hoped the Baroness would always come
      and dine with them; it would give them so much pleasure; and, in that
      case, she would spare herself the trouble of having a cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but I must have a cook!&rdquo; cried the Baroness. &ldquo;An old negress in a
      yellow turban. I have set my heart upon that. I want to look out of my
      window and see her sitting there on the grass, against the background of
      those crooked, dusky little apple trees, pulling the husks off a lapful of
      Indian corn. That will be local color, you know. There isn&rsquo;t much of it
      here&mdash;you don&rsquo;t mind my saying that, do you?&mdash;so one must make
      the most of what one can get. I shall be most happy to dine with you
      whenever you will let me; but I want to be able to ask you sometimes. And
      I want to be able to ask Mr. Acton,&rdquo; added the Baroness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must come and ask me at home,&rdquo; said Acton. &ldquo;You must come and see me;
      you must dine with me first. I want to show you my place; I want to
      introduce you to my mother.&rdquo; He called again upon Madame Münster, two
      days later. He was constantly at the other house; he used to walk across
      the fields from his own place, and he appeared to have fewer scruples than
      his cousins with regard to dropping in. On this occasion he found that Mr.
      Brand had come to pay his respects to the charming stranger; but after
      Acton&rsquo;s arrival the young theologian said nothing. He sat in his chair
      with his two hands clasped, fixing upon his hostess a grave, fascinated
      stare. The Baroness talked to Robert Acton, but, as she talked, she turned
      and smiled at Mr. Brand, who never took his eyes off her. The two men
      walked away together; they were going to Mr. Wentworth&rsquo;s. Mr. Brand still
      said nothing; but after they had passed into Mr. Wentworth&rsquo;s garden he
      stopped and looked back for some time at the little white house. Then,
      looking at his companion, with his head bent a little to one side and his
      eyes somewhat contracted, &ldquo;Now I suppose that&rsquo;s what is called
      conversation,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;real conversation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what I call a very clever woman,&rdquo; said Acton, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is most interesting,&rdquo; Mr. Brand continued. &ldquo;I only wish she would
      speak French; it would seem more in keeping. It must be quite the style
      that we have heard about, that we have read about&mdash;the style of
      conversation of Madame de Staël, of Madame Récamier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Acton also looked at Madame Münster&rsquo;s residence among its hollyhocks and
      apple trees. &ldquo;What I should like to know,&rdquo; he said, smiling, &ldquo;is just what
      has brought Madame Récamier to live in that place!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Wentworth, with his cane and his gloves in his hand, went every
      afternoon to call upon his niece. A couple of hours later she came over to
      the great house to tea. She had let the proposal that she should regularly
      dine there fall to the ground; she was in the enjoyment of whatever
      satisfaction was to be derived from the spectacle of an old negress in a
      crimson turban shelling peas under the apple trees. Charlotte, who had
      provided the ancient negress, thought it must be a strange household,
      Eugenia having told her that Augustine managed everything, the ancient
      negress included&mdash;Augustine who was naturally devoid of all
      acquaintance with the expurgatory English tongue. By far the most immoral
      sentiment which I shall have occasion to attribute to Charlotte Wentworth
      was a certain emotion of disappointment at finding that, in spite of these
      irregular conditions, the domestic arrangements at the small house were
      apparently not&mdash;from Eugenia&rsquo;s peculiar point of view&mdash;strikingly
      offensive. The Baroness found it amusing to go to tea; she dressed as if
      for dinner. The tea-table offered an anomalous and picturesque repast; and
      on leaving it they all sat and talked in the large piazza, or wandered
      about the garden in the starlight, with their ears full of those sounds of
      strange insects which, though they are supposed to be, all over the world,
      a part of the magic of summer nights, seemed to the Baroness to have
      beneath these western skies an incomparable resonance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wentworth, though, as I say, he went punctiliously to call upon her,
      was not able to feel that he was getting used to his niece. It taxed his
      imagination to believe that she was really his half-sister&rsquo;s child. His
      sister was a figure of his early years; she had been only twenty when she
      went abroad, never to return, making in foreign parts a willful and
      undesirable marriage. His aunt, Mrs. Whiteside, who had taken her to
      Europe for the benefit of the tour, gave, on her return, so lamentable an
      account of Mr. Adolphus Young, to whom the headstrong girl had united her
      destiny, that it operated as a chill upon family feeling&mdash;especially
      in the case of the half-brothers. Catherine had done nothing subsequently
      to propitiate her family; she had not even written to them in a way that
      indicated a lucid appreciation of their suspended sympathy; so that it had
      become a tradition in Boston circles that the highest charity, as regards
      this young lady, was to think it well to forget her, and to abstain from
      conjecture as to the extent to which her aberrations were reproduced in
      her descendants. Over these young people&mdash;a vague report of their
      existence had come to his ears&mdash;Mr. Wentworth had not, in the course
      of years, allowed his imagination to hover. It had plenty of occupation
      nearer home, and though he had many cares upon his conscience the idea
      that he had been an unnatural uncle was, very properly, never among the
      number. Now that his nephew and niece had come before him, he perceived
      that they were the fruit of influences and circumstances very different
      from those under which his own familiar progeny had reached a
      vaguely-qualified maturity. He felt no provocation to say that these
      influences had been exerted for evil; but he was sometimes afraid that he
      should not be able to like his distinguished, delicate, lady-like niece.
      He was paralyzed and bewildered by her foreignness. She spoke, somehow, a
      different language. There was something strange in her words. He had a
      feeling that another man, in his place, would accommodate himself to her
      tone; would ask her questions and joke with her, reply to those
      pleasantries of her own which sometimes seemed startling as addressed to
      an uncle. But Mr. Wentworth could not do these things. He could not even
      bring himself to attempt to measure her position in the world. She was the
      wife of a foreign nobleman who desired to repudiate her. This had a
      singular sound, but the old man felt himself destitute of the materials
      for a judgment. It seemed to him that he ought to find them in his own
      experience, as a man of the world and an almost public character; but they
      were not there, and he was ashamed to confess to himself&mdash;much more
      to reveal to Eugenia by interrogations possibly too innocent&mdash;the
      unfurnished condition of this repository.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared to him that he could get much nearer, as he would have said,
      to his nephew; though he was not sure that Felix was altogether safe. He
      was so bright and handsome and talkative that it was impossible not to
      think well of him; and yet it seemed as if there were something almost
      impudent, almost vicious&mdash;or as if there ought to be&mdash;in a young
      man being at once so joyous and so positive. It was to be observed that
      while Felix was not at all a serious young man there was somehow more of
      him&mdash;he had more weight and volume and resonance&mdash;than a number
      of young men who were distinctly serious. While Mr. Wentworth meditated
      upon this anomaly his nephew was admiring him unrestrictedly. He thought
      him a most delicate, generous, high-toned old gentleman, with a very
      handsome head, of the ascetic type, which he promised himself the profit
      of sketching. Felix was far from having made a secret of the fact that he
      wielded the paint-brush, and it was not his own fault if it failed to be
      generally understood that he was prepared to execute the most striking
      likenesses on the most reasonable terms. &ldquo;He is an artist&mdash;my cousin
      is an artist,&rdquo; said Gertrude; and she offered this information to everyone
      who would receive it. She offered it to herself, as it were, by way of
      admonition and reminder; she repeated to herself at odd moments, in lonely
      places, that Felix was invested with this sacred character. Gertrude had
      never seen an artist before; she had only read about such people. They
      seemed to her a romantic and mysterious class, whose life was made up of
      those agreeable accidents that never happened to other persons. And it
      merely quickened her meditations on this point that Felix should declare,
      as he repeatedly did, that he was really not an artist. &ldquo;I have never gone
      into the thing seriously,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have never studied; I have had no
      training. I do a little of everything, and nothing well. I am only an
      amateur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It pleased Gertrude even more to think that he was an amateur than to
      think that he was an artist; the former word, to her fancy, had an even
      subtler connotation. She knew, however, that it was a word to use more
      soberly. Mr. Wentworth used it freely; for though he had not been exactly
      familiar with it, he found it convenient as a help toward classifying
      Felix, who, as a young man extremely clever and active and apparently
      respectable and yet not engaged in any recognized business, was an
      importunate anomaly. Of course the Baroness and her brother&mdash;she was
      always spoken of first&mdash;were a welcome topic of conversation between
      Mr. Wentworth and his daughters and their occasional visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the young man, your nephew, what is his profession?&rdquo; asked an old
      gentleman&mdash;Mr. Broderip, of Salem&mdash;who had been Mr. Wentworth&rsquo;s
      classmate at Harvard College in the year 1809, and who came into his
      office in Devonshire Street. (Mr. Wentworth, in his later years, used to
      go but three times a week to his office, where he had a large amount of
      highly confidential trust-business to transact.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s an amateur,&rdquo; said Felix&rsquo;s uncle, with folded hands, and with
      a certain satisfaction in being able to say it. And Mr. Broderip had gone
      back to Salem with a feeling that this was probably a &ldquo;European&rdquo;
       expression for a broker or a grain exporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to do your head, sir,&rdquo; said Felix to his uncle one evening,
      before them all&mdash;Mr. Brand and Robert Acton being also present. &ldquo;I
      think I should make a very fine thing of it. It&rsquo;s an interesting head; it&rsquo;s
      very mediaeval.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wentworth looked grave; he felt awkwardly, as if all the company had
      come in and found him standing before the looking-glass. &ldquo;The Lord made
      it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it is for man to make it over again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly the Lord made it,&rdquo; replied Felix, laughing, &ldquo;and he made it
      very well. But life has been touching up the work. It is a very
      interesting type of head. It&rsquo;s delightfully wasted and emaciated. The
      complexion is wonderfully bleached.&rdquo; And Felix looked round at the circle,
      as if to call their attention to these interesting points. Mr. Wentworth
      grew visibly paler. &ldquo;I should like to do you as an old prelate, an old
      cardinal, or the prior of an order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A prelate, a cardinal?&rdquo; murmured Mr. Wentworth. &ldquo;Do you refer to the
      Roman Catholic priesthood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean an old ecclesiastic who should have led a very pure, abstinent
      life. Now I take it that has been the case with you, sir; one sees it in
      your face,&rdquo; Felix proceeded. &ldquo;You have been very&mdash;a very moderate.
      Don&rsquo;t you think one always sees that in a man&rsquo;s face?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see more in a man&rsquo;s face than I should think of looking for,&rdquo; said
      Mr. Wentworth coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness rattled her fan, and gave her brilliant laugh. &ldquo;It is a risk
      to look so close!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;My uncle has some peccadilloes on his
      conscience.&rdquo; Mr. Wentworth looked at her, painfully at a loss; and in so
      far as the signs of a pure and abstinent life were visible in his face
      they were then probably peculiarly manifest. &ldquo;You are a <i>beau vieillard</i>,
      dear uncle,&rdquo; said Madame Münster, smiling with her foreign eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are paying me a compliment,&rdquo; said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, I am not the first woman that ever did so!&rdquo; cried the Baroness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are,&rdquo; said Mr. Wentworth gravely. And turning to Felix he
      added, in the same tone, &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t take my likeness. My children have
      my daguerreotype. That is quite satisfactory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t promise,&rdquo; said Felix, &ldquo;not to work your head into something!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wentworth looked at him and then at all the others; then he got up and
      slowly walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Felix,&rdquo; said Gertrude, in the silence that followed, &ldquo;I wish you would
      paint my portrait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charlotte wondered whether Gertrude was right in wishing this; and she
      looked at Mr. Brand as the most legitimate way of ascertaining. Whatever
      Gertrude did or said, Charlotte always looked at Mr. Brand. It was a
      standing pretext for looking at Mr. Brand&mdash;always, as Charlotte
      thought, in the interest of Gertrude&rsquo;s welfare. It is true that she felt a
      tremulous interest in Gertrude being right; for Charlotte, in her small,
      still way, was an heroic sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should be glad to have your portrait, Miss Gertrude,&rdquo; said Mr. Brand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be delighted to paint so charming a model,&rdquo; Felix declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you are so lovely, my dear?&rdquo; asked Lizzie Acton, with her
      little inoffensive pertness, biting off a knot in her knitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not because I think I am beautiful,&rdquo; said Gertrude, looking all
      round. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I am beautiful, at all.&rdquo; She spoke with a sort of
      conscious deliberateness; and it seemed very strange to Charlotte to hear
      her discussing this question so publicly. &ldquo;It is because I think it would
      be amusing to sit and be painted. I have always thought that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry you have not had better things to think about, my daughter,&rdquo;
       said Mr. Wentworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very beautiful, cousin Gertrude,&rdquo; Felix declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a compliment,&rdquo; said Gertrude. &ldquo;I put all the compliments I
      receive into a little money-jug that has a slit in the side. I shake them
      up and down, and they rattle. There are not many yet&mdash;only two or
      three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not a compliment,&rdquo; Felix rejoined. &ldquo;See; I am careful not to
      give it the form of a compliment. I didn&rsquo;t think you were beautiful at
      first. But you have come to seem so little by little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care, now, your jug doesn&rsquo;t burst!&rdquo; exclaimed Lizzie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think sitting for one&rsquo;s portrait is only one of the various forms of
      idleness,&rdquo; said Mr. Wentworth. &ldquo;Their name is legion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; cried Felix, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t be said to be idle when you are
      making a man work so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One might be painted while one is asleep,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Brand, as a
      contribution to the discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, do paint me while I am asleep,&rdquo; said Gertrude to Felix, smiling. And
      she closed her eyes a little. It had by this time become a matter of
      almost exciting anxiety to Charlotte what Gertrude would say or would do
      next.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to sit for her portrait on the following day&mdash;in the open
      air, on the north side of the piazza. &ldquo;I wish you would tell me what you
      think of us&mdash;how we seem to you,&rdquo; she said to Felix, as he sat before
      his easel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to me the best people in the world,&rdquo; said Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say that,&rdquo; Gertrude resumed, &ldquo;because it saves you the trouble of
      saying anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man glanced at her over the top of his canvas. &ldquo;What else should
      I say? It would certainly be a great deal of trouble to say anything
      different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Gertrude, &ldquo;you have seen people before that you have liked,
      have you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I have, thank Heaven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they have been very different from us,&rdquo; Gertrude went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That only proves,&rdquo; said Felix, &ldquo;that there are a thousand different ways
      of being good company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think us good company?&rdquo; asked Gertrude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Company for a king!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude was silent a moment; and then, &ldquo;There must be a thousand
      different ways of being dreary,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and sometimes I think we make
      use of them all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix stood up quickly, holding up his hand. &ldquo;If you could only keep that
      look on your face for half an hour&mdash;while I catch it!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It
      is uncommonly handsome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To look handsome for half an hour&mdash;that is a great deal to ask of
      me,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be the portrait of a young woman who has taken some vow, some
      pledge, that she repents of,&rdquo; said Felix, &ldquo;and who is thinking it over at
      leisure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have taken no vow, no pledge,&rdquo; said Gertrude, very gravely; &ldquo;I have
      nothing to repent of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear cousin, that was only a figure of speech. I am very sure that no
      one in your excellent family has anything to repent of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet we are always repenting!&rdquo; Gertrude exclaimed. &ldquo;That is what I
      mean by our being dreary. You know it perfectly well; you only pretend
      that you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix gave a quick laugh. &ldquo;The half hour is going on, and yet you are
      handsomer than ever. One must be careful what one says, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To me,&rdquo; said Gertrude, &ldquo;you can say anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix looked at her, as an artist might, and painted for some time in
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you seem to me different from your father and sister&mdash;from most
      of the people you have lived with,&rdquo; he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To say that one&rsquo;s self,&rdquo; Gertrude went on, &ldquo;is like saying&mdash;by
      implication, at least&mdash;that one is better. I am not better; I am much
      worse. But they say themselves that I am different. It makes them
      unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you accuse me of concealing my real impressions, I may admit that I
      think the tendency&mdash;among you generally&mdash;is to be made unhappy
      too easily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would tell that to my father,&rdquo; said Gertrude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might make him more unhappy!&rdquo; Felix exclaimed, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly would. I don&rsquo;t believe you have seen people like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my dear cousin, how do you know what I have seen?&rdquo; Felix demanded.
      &ldquo;How can I tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might tell me a great many things, if you only would. You have seen
      people like yourself&mdash;people who are bright and gay and fond of
      amusement. We are not fond of amusement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Felix, &ldquo;I confess that rather strikes me. You don&rsquo;t seem to me
      to get all the pleasure out of life that you might. You don&rsquo;t seem to me
      to enjoy..... Do you mind my saying this?&rdquo; he asked, pausing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please go on,&rdquo; said the girl, earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to me very well placed for enjoying. You have money and liberty
      and what is called in Europe a &lsquo;position.&rsquo; But you take a painful view of
      life, as one may say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One ought to think it bright and charming and delightful, eh?&rdquo; asked
      Gertrude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say so&mdash;if one can. It is true it all depends upon that,&rdquo;
       Felix added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know there is a great deal of misery in the world,&rdquo; said his model.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen a little of it,&rdquo; the young man rejoined. &ldquo;But it was all over
      there&mdash;beyond the sea. I don&rsquo;t see any here. This is a paradise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude said nothing; she sat looking at the dahlias and the
      currant-bushes in the garden, while Felix went on with his work. &ldquo;To
      &lsquo;enjoy,&rsquo;&rdquo; she began at last, &ldquo;to take life&mdash;not painfully, must one
      do something wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix gave his long, light laugh again. &ldquo;Seriously, I think not. And for
      this reason, among others: you strike me as very capable of enjoying, if
      the chance were given you, and yet at the same time as incapable of
      wrong-doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; said Gertrude, &ldquo;that you are very wrong in telling a person
      that she is incapable of that. We are never nearer to evil than when we
      believe that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are handsomer than ever,&rdquo; observed Felix, irrelevantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude had got used to hearing him say this. There was not so much
      excitement in it as at first. &ldquo;What ought one to do?&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;To
      give parties, to go to the theatre, to read novels, to keep late hours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s what one does or one doesn&rsquo;t do that promotes
      enjoyment,&rdquo; her companion answered. &ldquo;It is the general way of looking at
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They look at it as a discipline&mdash;that&rsquo;s what they do here. I have
      often been told that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s very good. But there is another way,&rdquo; added Felix, smiling:
      &ldquo;to look at it as an opportunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An opportunity&mdash;yes,&rdquo; said Gertrude. &ldquo;One would get more pleasure
      that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t attempt to say anything better for it than that it has been my
      own way&mdash;and that is not saying much!&rdquo; Felix had laid down his
      palette and brushes; he was leaning back, with his arms folded, to judge
      the effect of his work. &ldquo;And you know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am a very petty
      personage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a great deal of talent,&rdquo; said Gertrude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no,&rdquo; the young man rejoined, in a tone of cheerful impartiality,
      &ldquo;I have not a great deal of talent. It is nothing at all remarkable. I
      assure you I should know if it were. I shall always be obscure. The world
      will never hear of me.&rdquo; Gertrude looked at him with a strange feeling. She
      was thinking of the great world which he knew and which she did not, and
      how full of brilliant talents it must be, since it could afford to make
      light of his abilities. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t in general attach much importance to
      anything I tell you,&rdquo; he pursued; &ldquo;but you may believe me when I say this,&mdash;that
      I am little better than a good-natured feather-head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A feather-head?&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a species of Bohemian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Bohemian?&rdquo; Gertrude had never heard this term before, save as a
      geographical denomination; and she quite failed to understand the
      figurative meaning which her companion appeared to attach to it. But it
      gave her pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix had pushed back his chair and risen to his feet; he slowly came
      toward her, smiling. &ldquo;I am a sort of adventurer,&rdquo; he said, looking down at
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She got up, meeting his smile. &ldquo;An adventurer?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;I should
      like to hear your adventures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For an instant she believed that he was going to take her hand; but he
      dropped his own hands suddenly into the pockets of his painting-jacket.
      &ldquo;There is no reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have been an
      adventurer, but my adventures have been very innocent. They have all been
      happy ones; I don&rsquo;t think there are any I shouldn&rsquo;t tell. They were very
      pleasant and very pretty; I should like to go over them in memory. Sit
      down again, and I will begin,&rdquo; he added in a moment, with his naturally
      persuasive smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude sat down again on that day, and she sat down on several other
      days. Felix, while he plied his brush, told her a great many stories, and
      she listened with charmed avidity. Her eyes rested upon his lips; she was
      very serious; sometimes, from her air of wondering gravity, he thought she
      was displeased. But Felix never believed for more than a single moment in
      any displeasure of his own producing. This would have been fatuity if the
      optimism it expressed had not been much more a hope than a prejudice. It
      is beside the matter to say that he had a good conscience; for the best
      conscience is a sort of self-reproach, and this young man&rsquo;s brilliantly
      healthy nature spent itself in objective good intentions which were
      ignorant of any test save exactness in hitting their mark. He told
      Gertrude how he had walked over France and Italy with a painter&rsquo;s knapsack
      on his back, paying his way often by knocking off a flattering portrait of
      his host or hostess. He told her how he had played the violin in a little
      band of musicians&mdash;not of high celebrity&mdash;who traveled through
      foreign lands giving provincial concerts. He told her also how he had been
      a momentary ornament of a troupe of strolling actors, engaged in the
      arduous task of interpreting Shakespeare to French and German, Polish and
      Hungarian audiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this periodical recital was going on, Gertrude lived in a fantastic
      world; she seemed to herself to be reading a romance that came out in
      daily numbers. She had known nothing so delightful since the perusal of
      <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>. One afternoon she went to see her cousin, Mrs. Acton,
      Robert&rsquo;s mother, who was a great invalid, never leaving the house. She
      came back alone, on foot, across the fields&mdash;this being a short way
      which they often used. Felix had gone to Boston with her father, who
      desired to take the young man to call upon some of his friends, old
      gentlemen who remembered his mother&mdash;remembered her, but said nothing
      about her&mdash;and several of whom, with the gentle ladies their wives,
      had driven out from town to pay their respects at the little house among
      the apple trees, in vehicles which reminded the Baroness, who received her
      visitors with discriminating civility, of the large, light, rattling
      barouche in which she herself had made her journey to this neighborhood.
      The afternoon was waning; in the western sky the great picture of a New
      England sunset, painted in crimson and silver, was suspended from the
      zenith; and the stony pastures, as Gertrude traversed them, thinking
      intently to herself, were covered with a light, clear glow. At the open
      gate of one of the fields she saw from the distance a man&rsquo;s figure; he
      stood there as if he were waiting for her, and as she came nearer she
      recognized Mr. Brand. She had a feeling as of not having seen him for some
      time; she could not have said for how long, for it yet seemed to her that
      he had been very lately at the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I walk back with you?&rdquo; he asked. And when she had said that he might
      if he wanted, he observed that he had seen her and recognized her half a
      mile away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have very good eyes,&rdquo; said Gertrude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have very good eyes, Miss Gertrude,&rdquo; said Mr. Brand. She perceived
      that he meant something; but for a long time past Mr. Brand had constantly
      meant something, and she had almost got used to it. She felt, however,
      that what he meant had now a renewed power to disturb her, to perplex and
      agitate her. He walked beside her in silence for a moment, and then he
      added, &ldquo;I have had no trouble in seeing that you are beginning to avoid
      me. But perhaps,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;one needn&rsquo;t have had very good eyes to see
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not avoided you,&rdquo; said Gertrude, without looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you have been unconscious that you were avoiding me,&rdquo; Mr. Brand
      replied. &ldquo;You have not even known that I was there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you are here now, Mr. Brand!&rdquo; said Gertrude, with a little laugh.
      &ldquo;I know that very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made no rejoinder. He simply walked beside her slowly, as they were
      obliged to walk over the soft grass. Presently they came to another gate,
      which was closed. Mr. Brand laid his hand upon it, but he made no movement
      to open it; he stood and looked at his companion. &ldquo;You are very much
      interested&mdash;very much absorbed,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude glanced at him; she saw that he was pale and that he looked
      excited. She had never seen Mr. Brand excited before, and she felt that
      the spectacle, if fully carried out, would be impressive, almost painful.
      &ldquo;Absorbed in what?&rdquo; she asked. Then she looked away at the illuminated
      sky. She felt guilty and uncomfortable, and yet she was vexed with herself
      for feeling so. But Mr. Brand, as he stood there looking at her with his
      small, kind, persistent eyes, represented an immense body of
      half-obliterated obligations, that were rising again into a certain
      distinctness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have new interests, new occupations,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that
      I can say that you have new duties. We have always old ones, Gertrude,&rdquo; he
      added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please open the gate, Mr. Brand,&rdquo; she said; and she felt as if, in saying
      so, she were cowardly and petulant. But he opened the gate, and allowed
      her to pass; then he closed it behind himself. Before she had time to turn
      away he put out his hand and held her an instant by the wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to say something to you,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what you want to say,&rdquo; she answered. And she was on the point of
      adding, &ldquo;And I know just how you will say it;&rdquo; but these words she kept
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you, Gertrude,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I love you very much; I love you more
      than ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said the words just as she had known he would; she had heard them
      before. They had no charm for her; she had said to herself before that it
      was very strange. It was supposed to be delightful for a woman to listen
      to such words; but these seemed to her flat and mechanical. &ldquo;I wish you
      would forget that,&rdquo; she declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I&mdash;why should I?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have made you no promise&mdash;given you no pledge,&rdquo; she said, looking
      at him, with her voice trembling a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have let me feel that I have an influence over you. You have opened
      your mind to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never opened my mind to you, Mr. Brand!&rdquo; Gertrude cried, with some
      vehemence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you were not so frank as I thought&mdash;as we all thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what anyone else had to do with it!&rdquo; cried the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean your father and your sister. You know it makes them happy to think
      you will listen to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave a little laugh. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t make them happy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Nothing
      makes them happy. No one is happy here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think your cousin is very happy&mdash;Mr. Young,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Brand,
      in a soft, almost timid tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better for him!&rdquo; And Gertrude gave her little laugh again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man looked at her a moment. &ldquo;You are very much changed,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to hear it,&rdquo; Gertrude declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not. I have known you a long time, and I have loved you as you
      were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am much obliged to you,&rdquo; said Gertrude. &ldquo;I must be going home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He on his side, gave a little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You certainly do avoid me&mdash;you see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Avoid me, then,&rdquo; said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her again; and then, very gently, &ldquo;No I will not avoid you,&rdquo;
       he replied; &ldquo;but I will leave you, for the present, to yourself. I think
      you will remember&mdash;after a while&mdash;some of the things you have
      forgotten. I think you will come back to me; I have great faith in that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time his voice was very touching; there was a strong, reproachful
      force in what he said, and Gertrude could answer nothing. He turned away
      and stood there, leaning his elbows on the gate and looking at the
      beautiful sunset. Gertrude left him and took her way home again; but when
      she reached the middle of the next field she suddenly burst into tears.
      Her tears seemed to her to have been a long time gathering, and for some
      moments it was a kind of glee to shed them. But they presently passed
      away. There was something a little hard about Gertrude; and she never wept
      again.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Going of an afternoon to call upon his niece, Mr. Wentworth more than once
      found Robert Acton sitting in her little drawing-room. This was in no
      degree, to Mr. Wentworth, a perturbing fact, for he had no sense of
      competing with his young kinsman for Eugenia&rsquo;s good graces. Madame
      Münster&rsquo;s uncle had the highest opinion of Robert Acton, who, indeed, in
      the family at large, was the object of a great deal of undemonstrative
      appreciation. They were all proud of him, in so far as the charge of being
      proud may be brought against people who were, habitually, distinctly
      guiltless of the misdemeanor known as &ldquo;taking credit.&rdquo; They never boasted
      of Robert Acton, nor indulged in vainglorious reference to him; they never
      quoted the clever things he had said, nor mentioned the generous things he
      had done. But a sort of frigidly-tender faith in his unlimited goodness
      was a part of their personal sense of right; and there can, perhaps, be no
      better proof of the high esteem in which he was held than the fact that no
      explicit judgment was ever passed upon his actions. He was no more praised
      than he was blamed; but he was tacitly felt to be an ornament to his
      circle. He was the man of the world of the family. He had been to China
      and brought home a collection of curiosities; he had made a fortune&mdash;or
      rather he had quintupled a fortune already considerable; he was
      distinguished by that combination of celibacy, &ldquo;property,&rdquo; and good humor
      which appeals to even the most subdued imaginations; and it was taken for
      granted that he would presently place these advantages at the disposal of
      some well-regulated young woman of his own &ldquo;set.&rdquo; Mr. Wentworth was not a
      man to admit to himself that&mdash;his paternal duties apart&mdash;he
      liked any individual much better than all other individuals; but he
      thought Robert Acton extremely judicious; and this was perhaps as near an
      approach as he was capable of to the eagerness of preference, which his
      temperament repudiated as it would have disengaged itself from something
      slightly unchaste. Acton was, in fact, very judicious&mdash;and something
      more beside; and indeed it must be claimed for Mr. Wentworth that in the
      more illicit parts of his preference there hovered the vague adumbration
      of a belief that his cousin&rsquo;s final merit was a certain enviable capacity
      for whistling, rather gallantly, at the sanctions of mere judgment&mdash;for
      showing a larger courage, a finer quality of pluck, than common occasion
      demanded. Mr. Wentworth would never have risked the intimation that Acton
      was made, in the smallest degree, of the stuff of a hero; but this is
      small blame to him, for Robert would certainly never have risked it
      himself. Acton certainly exercised great discretion in all things&mdash;beginning
      with his estimate of himself. He knew that he was by no means so much of a
      man of the world as he was supposed to be in local circles; but it must be
      added that he knew also that his natural shrewdness had a reach of which
      he had never quite given local circles the measure. He was addicted to
      taking the humorous view of things, and he had discovered that even in the
      narrowest circles such a disposition may find frequent opportunities. Such
      opportunities had formed for some time&mdash;that is, since his return
      from China, a year and a half before&mdash;the most active element in this
      gentleman&rsquo;s life, which had just now a rather indolent air. He was
      perfectly willing to get married. He was very fond of books, and he had a
      handsome library; that is, his books were much more numerous than Mr.
      Wentworth&rsquo;s. He was also very fond of pictures; but it must be confessed,
      in the fierce light of contemporary criticism, that his walls were adorned
      with several rather abortive masterpieces. He had got his learning&mdash;and
      there was more of it than commonly appeared&mdash;at Harvard College; and
      he took a pleasure in old associations, which made it a part of his daily
      contentment to live so near this institution that he often passed it in
      driving to Boston. He was extremely interested in the Baroness Münster.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was very frank with him; or at least she intended to be. &ldquo;I am sure
      you find it very strange that I should have settled down in this
      out-of-the-way part of the world!&rdquo; she said to him three or four weeks
      after she had installed herself. &ldquo;I am certain you are wondering about my
      motives. They are very pure.&rdquo; The Baroness by this time was an old
      inhabitant; the best society in Boston had called upon her, and Clifford
      Wentworth had taken her several times to drive in his buggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert Acton was seated near her, playing with a fan; there were always
      several fans lying about her drawing-room, with long ribbons of different
      colors attached to them, and Acton was always playing with one. &ldquo;No, I
      don&rsquo;t find it at all strange,&rdquo; he said slowly, smiling. &ldquo;That a clever
      woman should turn up in Boston, or its suburbs&mdash;that does not require
      so much explanation. Boston is a very nice place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wish to make me contradict you,&rdquo; said the Baroness, &ldquo;<i>vous vous y
      prenez mal</i>. In certain moods there is nothing I am not capable of agreeing
      to. Boston is a paradise, and we are in the suburbs of Paradise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just now I am not at all in the suburbs; I am in the place itself,&rdquo;
       rejoined Acton, who was lounging a little in his chair. He was, however,
      not always lounging; and when he was he was not quite so relaxed as he
      pretended. To a certain extent, he sought refuge from shyness in this
      appearance of relaxation; and like many persons in the same circumstances
      he somewhat exaggerated the appearance. Beyond this, the air of being much
      at his ease was a cover for vigilant observation. He was more than
      interested in this clever woman, who, whatever he might say, was clever
      not at all after the Boston fashion; she plunged him into a kind of
      excitement, held him in vague suspense. He was obliged to admit to himself
      that he had never yet seen a woman just like this&mdash;not even in China.
      He was ashamed, for inscrutable reasons, of the vivacity of his emotion,
      and he carried it off, superficially, by taking, still superficially, the
      humorous view of Madame Münster. It was not at all true that he thought it
      very natural of her to have made this pious pilgrimage. It might have been
      said of him in advance that he was too good a Bostonian to regard in the
      light of an eccentricity the desire of even the remotest alien to visit
      the New England metropolis. This was an impulse for which, surely, no
      apology was needed; and Madame Münster was the fortunate possessor of
      several New England cousins. In fact, however, Madame Münster struck him
      as out of keeping with her little circle; she was at the best a very
      agreeable, a gracefully mystifying anomaly. He knew very well that it
      would not do to address these reflections too crudely to Mr. Wentworth; he
      would never have remarked to the old gentleman that he wondered what the
      Baroness was up to. And indeed he had no great desire to share his vague
      mistrust with anyone. There was a personal pleasure in it; the greatest
      pleasure he had known at least since he had come from China. He would keep
      the Baroness, for better or worse, to himself; he had a feeling that he
      deserved to enjoy a monopoly of her, for he was certainly the person who
      had most adequately gauged her capacity for social intercourse. Before
      long it became apparent to him that the Baroness was disposed to lay no
      tax upon such a monopoly.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day (he was sitting there again and playing with a fan) she asked him
      to apologize, should the occasion present itself, to certain people in
      Boston for her not having returned their calls. &ldquo;There are half a dozen
      places,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;a formidable list. Charlotte Wentworth has written it
      out for me, in a terrifically distinct hand. There is no ambiguity on the
      subject; I know perfectly where I must go. Mr. Wentworth informs me that
      the carriage is always at my disposal, and Charlotte offers to go with me,
      in a pair of tight gloves and a very stiff petticoat. And yet for three
      days I have been putting it off. They must think me horribly vicious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ask me to apologize,&rdquo; said Acton, &ldquo;but you don&rsquo;t tell me what excuse
      I can offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is more,&rdquo; the Baroness declared, &ldquo;than I am held to. It would be
      like my asking you to buy me a bouquet and giving you the money. I have no
      reason except that&mdash;somehow&mdash;it&rsquo;s too violent an effort. It is
      not inspiring. Wouldn&rsquo;t that serve as an excuse, in Boston? I am told
      they are very sincere; they don&rsquo;t tell fibs. And then Felix ought to go
      with me, and he is never in readiness. I don&rsquo;t see him. He is always
      roaming about the fields and sketching old barns, or taking ten-mile
      walks, or painting someone&rsquo;s portrait, or rowing on the pond, or flirting
      with Gertrude Wentworth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think it would amuse you to go and see a few people,&rdquo; said
      Acton. &ldquo;You are having a very quiet time of it here. It&rsquo;s a dull life for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, the quiet,&mdash;the quiet!&rdquo; the Baroness exclaimed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I
      like. It&rsquo;s rest. That&rsquo;s what I came here for. Amusement? I have had
      amusement. And as for seeing people&mdash;I have already seen a great many
      in my life. If it didn&rsquo;t sound ungracious I should say that I wish very
      humbly your people here would leave me alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Acton looked at her a moment, and she looked at him. She was a woman who
      took being looked at remarkably well. &ldquo;So you have come here for rest?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I may say. I came for many of those reasons that are no reasons&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      you know?&mdash;and yet that are really the best: to come away, to change,
      to break with everything. When once one comes away one must arrive
      somewhere, and I asked myself why I shouldn&rsquo;t arrive here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You certainly had time on the way!&rdquo; said Acton, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Münster looked at him again; and then, smiling: &ldquo;And I have
      certainly had time, since I got here, to ask myself why I came. However, I
      never ask myself idle questions. Here I am, and it seems to me you ought
      only to thank me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you go away you will see the difficulties I shall put in your path.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to put difficulties in my path?&rdquo; she asked, rearranging the
      rosebud in her corsage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The greatest of all&mdash;that of having been so agreeable&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I shall be unable to depart? Don&rsquo;t be too sure. I have left some
      very agreeable people over there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Acton, &ldquo;but it was to come here, where I am!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know of your existence. Excuse me for saying anything so rude;
      but, honestly speaking, I did not. No,&rdquo; the Baroness pursued, &ldquo;it was
      precisely not to see you&mdash;such people as you&mdash;that I came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such people as me?&rdquo; cried Acton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a sort of longing to come into those natural relations which I knew
      I should find here. Over there I had only, as I may say, artificial
      relations. Don&rsquo;t you see the difference?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The difference tells against me,&rdquo; said Acton. &ldquo;I suppose I am an
      artificial relation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conventional,&rdquo; declared the Baroness; &ldquo;very conventional.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there is one way in which the relation of a lady and a gentleman
      may always become natural,&rdquo; said Acton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean by their becoming lovers? That may be natural or not. And at any
      rate,&rdquo; rejoined Eugenia, <i>&ldquo;nous n&rsquo;en sommes pas là!&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      They were not, as yet; but a little later, when she began to go with him
      to drive, it might almost have seemed that they were. He came for her
      several times, alone, in his high &ldquo;wagon,&rdquo; drawn by a pair of charming
      light-limbed horses. It was different, her having gone with Clifford
      Wentworth, who was her cousin, and so much younger. It was not to be
      imagined that she should have a flirtation with Clifford, who was a mere
      shame-faced boy, and whom a large section of Boston society supposed to be
      &ldquo;engaged&rdquo; to Lizzie Acton. Not, indeed, that it was to be conceived that
      the Baroness was a possible party to any flirtation whatever; for she was
      undoubtedly a married lady. It was generally known that her matrimonial
      condition was of the &ldquo;morganatic&rdquo; order; but in its natural aversion to
      suppose that this meant anything less than absolute wedlock, the
      conscience of the community took refuge in the belief that it implied
      something even more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Acton wished her to think highly of American scenery, and he drove her to
      great distances, picking out the prettiest roads and the largest points of
      view. If we are good when we are contented, Eugenia&rsquo;s virtues should now
      certainly have been uppermost; for she found a charm in the rapid movement
      through a wild country, and in a companion who from time to time made the
      vehicle dip, with a motion like a swallow&rsquo;s flight, over roads of
      primitive construction, and who, as she felt, would do a great many things
      that she might ask him. Sometimes, for a couple of hours together, there
      were almost no houses; there were nothing but woods and rivers and lakes
      and horizons adorned with bright-looking mountains. It seemed to the
      Baroness very wild, as I have said, and lovely; but the impression added
      something to that sense of the enlargement of opportunity which had been
      born of her arrival in the New World.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day&mdash;it was late in the afternoon&mdash;Acton pulled up his
      horses on the crest of a hill which commanded a beautiful prospect. He let
      them stand a long time to rest, while he sat there and talked with Madame
      Münster. The prospect was beautiful in spite of there being nothing
      human within sight. There was a wilderness of woods, and the gleam of a
      distant river, and a glimpse of half the hill-tops in Massachusetts. The
      road had a wide, grassy margin, on the further side of which there flowed
      a deep, clear brook; there were wild flowers in the grass, and beside the
      brook lay the trunk of a fallen tree. Acton waited a while; at last a
      rustic wayfarer came trudging along the road. Acton asked him to hold the
      horses&mdash;a service he consented to render, as a friendly turn to a
      fellow-citizen. Then he invited the Baroness to descend, and the two
      wandered away, across the grass, and sat down on the log beside the brook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I imagine it doesn&rsquo;t remind you of Silberstadt,&rdquo; said Acton. It was the
      first time that he had mentioned Silberstadt to her, for particular
      reasons. He knew she had a husband there, and this was disagreeable to
      him; and, furthermore, it had been repeated to him that this husband
      wished to put her away&mdash;a state of affairs to which even indirect
      reference was to be deprecated. It was true, nevertheless, that the
      Baroness herself had often alluded to Silberstadt; and Acton had often
      wondered why her husband wished to get rid of her. It was a curious
      position for a lady&mdash;this being known as a repudiated wife; and it is
      worthy of observation that the Baroness carried it off with exceeding
      grace and dignity. She had made it felt, from the first, that there were
      two sides to the question, and that her own side, when she should choose
      to present it, would be replete with touching interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does not remind me of the town, of course,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;of the
      sculptured gables and the Gothic churches, of the wonderful Schloss, with
      its moat and its clustering towers. But it has a little look of some other
      parts of the principality. One might fancy one&rsquo;s self among those grand
      old German forests, those legendary mountains; the sort of country one
      sees from the windows at Schreckenstein.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is Schreckenstein?&rdquo; asked Acton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a great castle,&mdash;the summer residence of the Reigning Prince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever lived there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have stayed there,&rdquo; said the Baroness. Acton was silent; he looked a
      while at the uncastled landscape before him. &ldquo;It is the first time you
      have ever asked me about Silberstadt,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I should think you would
      want to know about my marriage; it must seem to you very strange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Acton looked at her a moment. &ldquo;Now you wouldn&rsquo;t like me to say that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You Americans have such odd ways!&rdquo; the Baroness declared. &ldquo;You never ask
      anything outright; there seem to be so many things you can&rsquo;t talk about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We Americans are very polite,&rdquo; said Acton, whose national consciousness
      had been complicated by a residence in foreign lands, and who yet disliked
      to hear Americans abused. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t like to tread upon people&rsquo;s toes,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;But I should like very much to hear about your marriage. Now tell
      me how it came about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Prince fell in love with me,&rdquo; replied the Baroness simply. &ldquo;He
      pressed his suit very hard. At first he didn&rsquo;t wish me to marry him; on
      the contrary. But on that basis I refused to listen to him. So he offered
      me marriage&mdash;in so far as he might. I was young, and I confess I was
      rather flattered. But if it were to be done again now, I certainly should
      not accept him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long ago was this?&rdquo; asked Acton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;several years,&rdquo; said Eugenia. &ldquo;You should never ask a woman for
      dates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I should think that when a woman was relating history &ldquo; Acton
      answered. &ldquo;And now he wants to break it off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They want him to make a political marriage. It is his brother&rsquo;s idea. His
      brother is very clever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must be a precious pair!&rdquo; cried Robert Acton.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness gave a little philosophic shrug. &ldquo;<i>Que voulez-vous?</i> They are
      princes. They think they are treating me very well. Silberstadt is a
      perfectly despotic little state, and the Reigning Prince may annul the
      marriage by a stroke of his pen. But he has promised me, nevertheless, not
      to do so without my formal consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this you have refused?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hitherto. It is an indignity, and I have wished at least to make it
      difficult for them. But I have a little document in my writing-desk which
      I have only to sign and send back to the Prince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it will be all over?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness lifted her hand, and dropped it again. &ldquo;Of course I shall
      keep my title; at least, I shall be at liberty to keep it if I choose. And
      I suppose I shall keep it. One must have a name. And I shall keep my
      pension. It is very small&mdash;it is wretchedly small; but it is what I
      live on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have only to sign that paper?&rdquo; Acton asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness looked at him a moment. &ldquo;Do you urge it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got up slowly, and stood with his hands in his pockets. &ldquo;What do you
      gain by not doing it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am supposed to gain this advantage&mdash;that if I delay, or temporize,
      the Prince may come back to me, may make a stand against his brother. He
      is very fond of me, and his brother has pushed him only little by little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he were to come back to you,&rdquo; said Acton, &ldquo;would you&mdash;would you
      take him back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness met his eyes; she colored just a little. Then she rose. &ldquo;I
      should have the satisfaction of saying, &lsquo;Now it is my turn. I break with
      your Serene Highness!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They began to walk toward the carriage. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Robert Acton, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
      a curious story! How did you make his acquaintance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was staying with an old lady&mdash;an old Countess&mdash;in Dresden.
      She had been a friend of my father&rsquo;s. My father was dead; I was very much
      alone. My brother was wandering about the world in a theatrical troupe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your brother ought to have stayed with you,&rdquo; Acton observed, &ldquo;and kept
      you from putting your trust in princes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness was silent a moment, and then, &ldquo;He did what he could,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;He sent me money. The old Countess encouraged the Prince; she was
      even pressing. It seems to me,&rdquo; Madame Münster added, gently, &ldquo;that&mdash;under
      the circumstances&mdash;I behaved very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Acton glanced at her, and made the observation&mdash;he had made it before&mdash;that
      a woman looks the prettier for having unfolded her wrongs or her
      sufferings. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he reflected, audibly, &ldquo;I should like to see you send
      his Serene Highness&mdash;somewhere!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Münster stooped and plucked a daisy from the grass. &ldquo;And not sign
      my renunciation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Acton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In one case I should have my revenge; in another case I should have my
      liberty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Acton gave a little laugh as he helped her into the carriage. &ldquo;At any
      rate,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;take good care of that paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A couple of days afterward he asked her to come and see his house. The
      visit had already been proposed, but it had been put off in consequence of
      his mother&rsquo;s illness. She was a constant invalid, and she had passed these
      recent years, very patiently, in a great flowered arm-chair at her bedroom
      window. Lately, for some days, she had been unable to see anyone; but now
      she was better, and she sent the Baroness a very civil message. Acton had
      wished their visitor to come to dinner; but Madame Münster preferred
      to begin with a simple call. She had reflected that if she should go to
      dinner Mr. Wentworth and his daughters would also be asked, and it had
      seemed to her that the peculiar character of the occasion would be best
      preserved in a <i>tête-à-tête</i> with her host. Why the occasion should have a
      peculiar character she explained to no one. As far as anyone could see,
      it was simply very pleasant. Acton came for her and drove her to his door,
      an operation which was rapidly performed. His house the Baroness mentally
      pronounced a very good one; more articulately, she declared that it was
      enchanting. It was large and square and painted brown; it stood in a
      well-kept shrubbery, and was approached, from the gate, by a short drive.
      It was, moreover, a much more modern dwelling than Mr. Wentworth&rsquo;s, and
      was more redundantly upholstered and expensively ornamented. The Baroness
      perceived that her entertainer had analyzed material comfort to a
      sufficiently fine point. And then he possessed the most delightful
      <i>chinoiseries</i>&mdash;trophies of his sojourn in the Celestial Empire:
      pagodas of ebony and cabinets of ivory; sculptured monsters, grinning and
      leering on chimney-pieces, in front of beautifully figured hand-screens;
      porcelain dinner-sets, gleaming behind the glass doors of mahogany
      buffets; large screens, in corners, covered with tense silk and
      embroidered with mandarins and dragons. These things were scattered all
      over the house, and they gave Eugenia a pretext for a complete domiciliary
      visit. She liked it, she enjoyed it; she thought it a very nice place. It
      had a mixture of the homely and the liberal, and though it was almost a
      museum, the large, little-used rooms were as fresh and clean as a
      well-kept dairy. Lizzie Acton told her that she dusted all the pagodas and
      other curiosities every day with her own hands; and the Baroness answered
      that she was evidently a household fairy. Lizzie had not at all the look
      of a young lady who dusted things; she wore such pretty dresses and had
      such delicate fingers that it was difficult to imagine her immersed in
      sordid cares. She came to meet Madame Münster on her arrival, but she
      said nothing, or almost nothing, and the Baroness again reflected&mdash;she
      had had occasion to do so before&mdash;that American girls had no manners.
      She disliked this little American girl, and she was quite prepared to
      learn that she had failed to commend herself to Miss Acton. Lizzie struck
      her as positive and explicit almost to pertness; and the idea of her
      combining the apparent incongruities of a taste for housework and the
      wearing of fresh, Parisian-looking dresses suggested the possession of a
      dangerous energy. It was a source of irritation to the Baroness that in
      this country it should seem to matter whether a little girl were a trifle
      less or a trifle more of a nonentity; for Eugenia had hitherto been
      conscious of no moral pressure as regards the appreciation of diminutive
      virgins. It was perhaps an indication of Lizzie&rsquo;s pertness that she very
      soon retired and left the Baroness on her brother&rsquo;s hands. Acton talked a
      great deal about his <i>chinoiseries</i>; he knew a good deal about porcelain and
      bric-à-brac. The Baroness, in her progress through the house, made, as it
      were, a great many stations. She sat down everywhere, confessed to being a
      little tired, and asked about the various objects with a curious mixture
      of alertness and inattention. If there had been anyone to say it to she
      would have declared that she was positively in love with her host; but she
      could hardly make this declaration&mdash;even in the strictest confidence&mdash;to
      Acton himself. It gave her, nevertheless, a pleasure that had some of the
      charm of unwontedness to feel, with that admirable keenness with which she
      was capable of feeling things, that he had a disposition without any
      edges; that even his humorous irony always expanded toward the point.
      One&rsquo;s impression of his honesty was almost like carrying a bunch of
      flowers; the perfume was most agreeable, but they were occasionally an
      inconvenience. One could trust him, at any rate, round all the corners of
      the world; and, withal, he was not absolutely simple, which would have
      been excess; he was only relatively simple, which was quite enough for the
      Baroness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lizzie reappeared to say that her mother would now be happy to receive
      Madame Münster; and the Baroness followed her to Mrs. Acton&rsquo;s apartment.
      Eugenia reflected, as she went, that it was not the affectation of
      impertinence that made her dislike this young lady, for on that ground she
      could easily have beaten her. It was not an aspiration on the girl&rsquo;s part
      to rivalry, but a kind of laughing, childishly-mocking indifference to the
      results of comparison. Mrs. Acton was an emaciated, sweet-faced woman of
      five and fifty, sitting with pillows behind her, and looking out on a
      clump of hemlocks. She was very modest, very timid, and very ill; she made
      Eugenia feel grateful that she herself was not like that&mdash;neither so
      ill, nor, possibly, so modest. On a chair, beside her, lay a volume of
      Emerson&rsquo;s Essays. It was a great occasion for poor Mrs. Acton, in her
      helpless condition, to be confronted with a clever foreign lady, who had
      more manner than any lady&mdash;any dozen ladies&mdash;that she had ever
      seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard a great deal about you,&rdquo; she said, softly, to the Baroness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From your son, eh?&rdquo; Eugenia asked. &ldquo;He has talked to me immensely of you.
      Oh, he talks of you as you would like,&rdquo; the Baroness declared; &ldquo;as such a
      son <i>must</i> talk of such a mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Acton sat gazing; this was part of Madame Münster&rsquo;s &ldquo;manner.&rdquo; But
      Robert Acton was gazing too, in vivid consciousness that he had barely
      mentioned his mother to their brilliant guest. He never talked of this
      still maternal presence,&mdash;a presence refined to such delicacy that it
      had almost resolved itself, with him, simply into the subjective emotion
      of gratitude. And Acton rarely talked of his emotions. The Baroness turned
      her smile toward him, and she instantly felt that she had been observed to
      be fibbing. She had struck a false note. But who were these people to whom
      such fibbing was not pleasing? If they were annoyed, the Baroness was
      equally so; and after the exchange of a few civil inquiries and low-voiced
      responses she took leave of Mrs. Acton. She begged Robert not to come home
      with her; she would get into the carriage alone; she preferred that. This
      was imperious, and she thought he looked disappointed. While she stood
      before the door with him&mdash;the carriage was turning in the gravel-walk&mdash;this
      thought restored her serenity.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had given him her hand in farewell she looked at him a moment. &ldquo;I
      have almost decided to dispatch that paper,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that she alluded to the document that she had called her
      renunciation; and he assisted her into the carriage without saying
      anything. But just before the vehicle began to move he said, &ldquo;Well, when
      you have in fact dispatched it, I hope you will let me know!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Felix Young finished Gertrude&rsquo;s portrait, and he afterwards transferred to
      canvas the features of many members of that circle of which it may be said
      that he had become for the time the pivot and the centre. I am afraid it
      must be confessed that he was a decidedly flattering painter, and that he
      imparted to his models a romantic grace which seemed easily and cheaply
      acquired by the payment of a hundred dollars to a young man who made
      &ldquo;sitting&rdquo; so entertaining. For Felix was paid for his pictures, making, as
      he did, no secret of the fact that in guiding his steps to the Western
      world affectionate curiosity had gone hand in hand with a desire to better
      his condition. He took his uncle&rsquo;s portrait quite as if Mr. Wentworth had
      never averted himself from the experiment; and as he compassed his end
      only by the exercise of gentle violence, it is but fair to add that he
      allowed the old man to give him nothing but his time. He passed his arm
      into Mr. Wentworth&rsquo;s one summer morning&mdash;very few arms indeed had
      ever passed into Mr. Wentworth&rsquo;s&mdash;and led him across the garden and
      along the road into the studio which he had extemporized in the little
      house among the apple trees. The grave gentleman felt himself more and
      more fascinated by his clever nephew, whose fresh, demonstrative youth
      seemed a compendium of experiences so strangely numerous. It appeared to
      him that Felix must know a great deal; he would like to learn what he
      thought about some of those things as regards which his own conversation
      had always been formal, but his knowledge vague. Felix had a confident,
      gayly trenchant way of judging human actions which Mr. Wentworth grew
      little by little to envy; it seemed like criticism made easy. Forming an
      opinion&mdash;say on a person&rsquo;s conduct&mdash;was, with Mr. Wentworth, a
      good deal like fumbling in a lock with a key chosen at hazard. He seemed
      to himself to go about the world with a big bunch of these ineffectual
      instruments at his girdle. His nephew, on the other hand, with a single
      turn of the wrist, opened any door as adroitly as a horse-thief. He felt
      obliged to keep up the convention that an uncle is always wiser than a
      nephew, even if he could keep it up no otherwise than by listening in
      serious silence to Felix&rsquo;s quick, light, constant discourse. But there
      came a day when he lapsed from consistency and almost asked his nephew&rsquo;s
      advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever entertained the idea of settling in the United States?&rdquo; he
      asked one morning, while Felix brilliantly plied his brush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear uncle,&rdquo; said Felix, &ldquo;excuse me if your question makes me smile a
      little. To begin with, I have never entertained an idea. Ideas often
      entertain <i>me</i>; but I am afraid I have never seriously made a plan. I know
      what you are going to say; or rather, I know what you think, for I don&rsquo;t
      think you will say it&mdash;that this is very frivolous and loose-minded
      on my part. So it is; but I am made like that; I take things as they come,
      and somehow there is always some new thing to follow the last. In the
      second place, I should never propose to <i>settle</i>. I can&rsquo;t settle, my dear
      uncle; I&rsquo;m not a settler. I know that is what strangers are supposed to
      do here; they always settle. But I haven&rsquo;t&mdash;to answer your question&mdash;entertained
      that idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You intend to return to Europe and resume your irregular manner of life?&rdquo;
       Mr. Wentworth inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I intend. But it&rsquo;s very likely I shall go back to Europe.
      After all, I am a European. I feel that, you know. It will depend a good
      deal upon my sister. She&rsquo;s even more of a European than I; here, you
      know, she&rsquo;s a picture out of her setting. And as for &lsquo;resuming,&rsquo; dear
      uncle, I really have never given up my irregular manner of life. What, for
      me, could be more irregular than this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Than what?&rdquo; asked Mr. Wentworth, with his pale gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, than everything! Living in the midst of you, this way; this
      charming, quiet, serious family life; fraternizing with Charlotte and
      Gertrude; calling upon twenty young ladies and going out to walk with
      them; sitting with you in the evening on the piazza and listening to the
      crickets, and going to bed at ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your description is very animated,&rdquo; said Mr. Wentworth; &ldquo;but I see
      nothing improper in what you describe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither do I, dear uncle. It is extremely delightful; I shouldn&rsquo;t like
      it if it were improper. I assure you I don&rsquo;t like improper things; though
      I dare say you think I do,&rdquo; Felix went on, painting away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never accused you of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Felix, &ldquo;because, you see, at bottom I am a terrible
      Philistine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Philistine?&rdquo; repeated Mr. Wentworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, as one may say, a plain, God-fearing man.&rdquo; Mr. Wentworth looked
      at him reservedly, like a mystified sage, and Felix continued, &ldquo;I trust I
      shall enjoy a venerable and venerated old age. I mean to live long. I can
      hardly call that a plan, perhaps; but it&rsquo;s a keen desire&mdash;a rosy
      vision. I shall be a lively, perhaps even a frivolous old man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is natural,&rdquo; said his uncle, sententiously, &ldquo;that one should desire to
      prolong an agreeable life. We have perhaps a selfish indisposition to
      bring our pleasure to a close. But I presume,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that you expect
      to marry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That too, dear uncle, is a hope, a desire, a vision,&rdquo; said Felix. It
      occurred to him for an instant that this was possibly a preface to the
      offer of the hand of one of Mr. Wentworth&rsquo;s admirable daughters. But in
      the name of decent modesty and a proper sense of the hard realities of
      this world, Felix banished the thought. His uncle was the incarnation of
      benevolence, certainly; but from that to accepting&mdash;much more
      postulating&mdash;the idea of a union between a young lady with a dowry
      presumptively brilliant and a penniless artist with no prospect of fame,
      there was a very long way. Felix had lately become conscious of a
      luxurious preference for the society&mdash;if possible unshared with
      others&mdash;of Gertrude Wentworth; but he had relegated this young lady,
      for the moment, to the coldly brilliant category of unattainable
      possessions. She was not the first woman for whom he had entertained an
      unpractical admiration. He had been in love with duchesses and countesses,
      and he had made, once or twice, a perilously near approach to cynicism in
      declaring that the disinterestedness of women had been overrated. On the
      whole, he had tempered audacity with modesty; and it is but fair to him
      now to say explicitly that he would have been incapable of taking
      advantage of his present large allowance of familiarity to make love to
      the younger of his handsome cousins. Felix had grown up among traditions
      in the light of which such a proceeding looked like a grievous breach of
      hospitality. I have said that he was always happy, and it may be counted
      among the present sources of his happiness that he had as regards this
      matter of his relations with Gertrude a deliciously good conscience. His
      own deportment seemed to him suffused with the beauty of virtue&mdash;a
      form of beauty that he admired with the same vivacity with which he
      admired all other forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that if you marry,&rdquo; said Mr. Wentworth presently, &ldquo;it will
      conduce to your happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Sicurissimo!&rdquo;</i> Felix exclaimed; and then, arresting his brush, he looked
      at his uncle with a smile. &ldquo;There is something I feel tempted to say to
      you. May I risk it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wentworth drew himself up a little. &ldquo;I am very safe; I don&rsquo;t repeat
      things.&rdquo; But he hoped Felix would not risk too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix was laughing at his answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s odd to hear you telling me how to be happy. I don&rsquo;t think you know
      yourself, dear uncle. Now, does that sound brutal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man was silent a moment, and then, with a dry dignity that
      suddenly touched his nephew: &ldquo;We may sometimes point out a road we are
      unable to follow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, don&rsquo;t tell me you have had any sorrows,&rdquo; Felix rejoined. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
      suppose it, and I didn&rsquo;t mean to allude to them. I simply meant that you
      all don&rsquo;t amuse yourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amuse ourselves? We are not children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely not! You have reached the proper age. I was saying that the
      other day to Gertrude,&rdquo; Felix added. &ldquo;I hope it was not indiscreet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it was,&rdquo; said Mr. Wentworth, with a keener irony than Felix would have
      thought him capable of, &ldquo;it was but your way of amusing yourself. I am
      afraid you have never had a trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I have!&rdquo; Felix declared, with some spirit; &ldquo;before I knew
      better. But you don&rsquo;t catch me at it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wentworth maintained for a while a silence more expressive than a
      deep-drawn sigh. &ldquo;You have no children,&rdquo; he said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me,&rdquo; Felix exclaimed, &ldquo;that your charming young people are a
      source of grief to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t speak of Charlotte.&rdquo; And then, after a pause, Mr. Wentworth
      continued, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t speak of Gertrude. But I feel considerable anxiety
      about Clifford. I will tell you another time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next time he gave Felix a sitting his nephew reminded him that he had
      taken him into his confidence. &ldquo;How is Clifford today?&rdquo; Felix asked. &ldquo;He
      has always seemed to me a young man of remarkable discretion. Indeed, he
      is only too discreet; he seems on his guard against me&mdash;as if he
      thought me rather light company. The other day he told his sister&mdash;Gertrude
      repeated it to me&mdash;that I was always laughing at him. If I laugh it
      is simply from the impulse to try and inspire him with confidence. That is
      the only way I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clifford&rsquo;s situation is no laughing matter,&rdquo; said Mr. Wentworth. &ldquo;It is
      very peculiar, as I suppose you have guessed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you mean his love affair with his cousin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wentworth stared, blushing a little. &ldquo;I mean his absence from college.
      He has been suspended. We have decided not to speak of it unless we are
      asked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suspended?&rdquo; Felix repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been requested by the Harvard authorities to absent himself for
      six months. Meanwhile he is studying with Mr. Brand. We think Mr. Brand
      will help him; at least we hope so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What befell him at college?&rdquo; Felix asked. &ldquo;He was too fond of pleasure?
      Mr. Brand certainly will not teach him any of those secrets!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was too fond of something of which he should not have been fond. I
      suppose it is considered a pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix gave his light laugh. &ldquo;My dear uncle, is there any doubt about its
      being a pleasure? <i>C&rsquo;est de son âge</i>, as they say in France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have said rather it was a vice of later life&mdash;of
      disappointed old age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix glanced at his uncle, with his lifted eyebrows, and then, &ldquo;Of what
      are you speaking?&rdquo; he demanded, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of the situation in which Clifford was found.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, he was found&mdash;he was caught?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Necessarily, he was caught. He couldn&rsquo;t walk; he staggered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Felix, &ldquo;he drinks! I rather suspected that, from something I
      observed the first day I came here. I quite agree with you that it is a
      low taste. It&rsquo;s not a vice for a gentleman. He ought to give it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We hope for a good deal from Mr. Brand&rsquo;s influence,&rdquo; Mr. Wentworth went
      on. &ldquo;He has talked to him from the first. And he never touches anything
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will talk to him&mdash;I will talk to him!&rdquo; Felix declared, gayly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you say to him?&rdquo; asked his uncle, with some apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix for some moments answered nothing. &ldquo;Do you mean to marry him to his
      cousin?&rdquo; he asked at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marry him?&rdquo; echoed Mr. Wentworth. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think his cousin would
      want to marry him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no understanding, then, with Mrs. Acton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wentworth stared, almost blankly. &ldquo;I have never discussed such
      subjects with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think it might be time,&rdquo; said Felix. &ldquo;Lizzie Acton is admirably
      pretty, and if Clifford is dangerous....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are not engaged,&rdquo; said Mr. Wentworth. &ldquo;I have no reason to suppose
      they are engaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Par exemple!&rdquo;</i> cried Felix. &ldquo;A clandestine engagement? Trust me, Clifford,
      as I say, is a charming boy. He is incapable of that. Lizzie Acton, then,
      would not be jealous of another woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly hope not,&rdquo; said the old man, with a vague sense of jealousy
      being an even lower vice than a love of liquor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best thing for Clifford, then,&rdquo; Felix propounded, &ldquo;is to become
      interested in some clever, charming woman.&rdquo; And he paused in his painting,
      and, with his elbows on his knees, looked with bright communicativeness at
      his uncle. &ldquo;You see, I believe greatly in the influence of women. Living
      with women helps to make a man a gentleman. It is very true Clifford has
      his sisters, who are so charming. But there should be a different
      sentiment in play from the fraternal, you know. He has Lizzie Acton; but
      she, perhaps, is rather immature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suspect Lizzie has talked to him, reasoned with him,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Wentworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the impropriety of getting tipsy&mdash;on the beauty of temperance?
      That is dreary work for a pretty young girl. No,&rdquo; Felix continued;
      &ldquo;Clifford ought to frequent some agreeable woman, who, without ever
      mentioning such unsavory subjects, would give him a sense of its being
      very ridiculous to be fuddled. If he could fall in love with her a little,
      so much the better. The thing would operate as a cure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, what lady should you suggest?&rdquo; asked Mr. Wentworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a clever woman under your hand. My sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sister&mdash;under my hand?&rdquo; Mr. Wentworth repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say a word to Clifford. Tell him to be bold. He is well disposed already;
      he has invited her two or three times to drive. But I don&rsquo;t think he comes
      to see her. Give him a hint to come&mdash;to come often. He will sit there
      of an afternoon, and they will talk. It will do him good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wentworth meditated. &ldquo;You think she will exercise a helpful
      influence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will exercise a civilizing&mdash;I may call it a sobering&mdash;influence.
      A charming, clever, witty woman always does&mdash;especially if she is a
      little of a coquette. My dear uncle, the society of such women has been
      half my education. If Clifford is suspended, as you say, from college, let
      Eugenia be his preceptress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wentworth continued thoughtful. &ldquo;You think Eugenia is a coquette?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What pretty woman is not?&rdquo; Felix demanded in turn. But this, for Mr.
      Wentworth, could at the best have been no answer, for he did not think his
      niece pretty. &ldquo;With Clifford,&rdquo; the young man pursued, &ldquo;Eugenia will simply
      be enough of a coquette to be a little ironical. That&rsquo;s what he needs. So
      you recommend him to be nice with her, you know. The suggestion will come
      best from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I understand,&rdquo; asked the old man, &ldquo;that I am to suggest to my son to
      make a&mdash;a profession of&mdash;of affection to Madame Münster?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;a profession!&rdquo; cried Felix sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, as I understand it, Madame Münster is a married woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Felix, smiling, &ldquo;of course she can&rsquo;t marry him. But she will do
      what she can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wentworth sat for some time with his eyes on the floor; at last he got
      up. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I can undertake to recommend my son
      any such course.&rdquo; And without meeting Felix&rsquo;s surprised glance he broke
      off his sitting, which was not resumed for a fortnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix was very fond of the little lake which occupied so many of Mr.
      Wentworth&rsquo;s numerous acres, and of a remarkable pine grove which lay upon
      the further side of it, planted upon a steep embankment and haunted by the
      summer breeze. The murmur of the air in the far off tree-tops had a
      strange distinctness; it was almost articulate. One afternoon the young
      man came out of his painting-room and passed the open door of Eugenia&rsquo;s
      little salon. Within, in the cool dimness, he saw his sister, dressed in
      white, buried in her arm-chair, and holding to her face an immense
      bouquet. Opposite to her sat Clifford Wentworth, twirling his hat. He had
      evidently just presented the bouquet to the Baroness, whose fine eyes, as
      she glanced at him over the big roses and geraniums, wore a conversational
      smile. Felix, standing on the threshold of the cottage, hesitated for a
      moment as to whether he should retrace his steps and enter the parlor.
      Then he went his way and passed into Mr. Wentworth&rsquo;s garden. That
      civilizing process to which he had suggested that Clifford should be
      subjected appeared to have come on of itself. Felix was very sure, at
      least, that Mr. Wentworth had not adopted his ingenious device for
      stimulating the young man&rsquo;s aesthetic consciousness. &ldquo;Doubtless he
      supposes,&rdquo; he said to himself, after the conversation that has been
      narrated, &ldquo;that I desire, out of fraternal benevolence, to procure for
      Eugenia the amusement of a flirtation&mdash;or, as he probably calls it,
      an intrigue&mdash;with the too susceptible Clifford. It must be admitted&mdash;and
      I have noticed it before&mdash;that nothing exceeds the license
      occasionally taken by the imagination of very rigid people.&rdquo; Felix, on his
      own side, had of course said nothing to Clifford; but he had observed to
      Eugenia that Mr. Wentworth was much mortified at his son&rsquo;s low tastes. &ldquo;We
      ought to do something to help them, after all their kindness to us,&rdquo; he
      had added. &ldquo;Encourage Clifford to come and see you, and inspire him with a
      taste for conversation. That will supplant the other, which only comes
      from his puerility, from his not taking his position in the world&mdash;that
      of a rich young man of ancient stock&mdash;seriously enough. Make him a
      little more serious. Even if he makes love to you it is no great matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am to offer myself as a superior form of intoxication&mdash;a
      substitute for a brandy bottle, eh?&rdquo; asked the Baroness. &ldquo;Truly, in this
      country one comes to strange uses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she had not positively declined to undertake Clifford&rsquo;s higher
      education, and Felix, who had not thought of the matter again, being
      haunted with visions of more personal profit, now reflected that the work
      of redemption had fairly begun. The idea in prospect had seemed of the
      happiest, but in operation it made him a trifle uneasy. &ldquo;What if Eugenia&mdash;what
      if Eugenia&rdquo;&mdash;he asked himself softly; the question dying away in his
      sense of Eugenia&rsquo;s undetermined capacity. But before Felix had time either
      to accept or to reject its admonition, even in this vague form, he saw
      Robert Acton turn out of Mr. Wentworth&rsquo;s enclosure, by a distant gate, and
      come toward the cottage in the orchard. Acton had evidently walked from
      his own house along a shady by-way and was intending to pay a visit to
      Madame Münster. Felix watched him a moment; then he turned away. Acton
      could be left to play the part of Providence and interrupt&mdash;if
      interruption were needed&mdash;Clifford&rsquo;s entanglement with Eugenia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix passed through the garden toward the house and toward a postern gate
      which opened upon a path leading across the fields, beside a little wood,
      to the lake. He stopped and looked up at the house; his eyes rested more
      particularly upon a certain open window, on the shady side. Presently
      Gertrude appeared there, looking out into the summer light. He took off
      his hat to her and bade her good-day; he remarked that he was going to row
      across the pond, and begged that she would do him the honor to accompany
      him. She looked at him a moment; then, without saying anything, she turned
      away. But she soon reappeared below in one of those quaint and charming
      Leghorn hats, tied with white satin bows, that were worn at that period;
      she also carried a green parasol. She went with him to the edge of the
      lake, where a couple of boats were always moored; they got into one of
      them, and Felix, with gentle strokes, propelled it to the opposite shore.
      The day was the perfection of summer weather; the little lake was the
      color of sunshine; the plash of the oars was the only sound, and they
      found themselves listening to it. They disembarked, and, by a winding
      path, ascended the pine-crested mound which overlooked the water, whose
      white expanse glittered between the trees. The place was delightfully
      cool, and had the added charm that&mdash;in the softly sounding pine
      boughs&mdash;you seemed to hear the coolness as well as feel it. Felix and
      Gertrude sat down on the rust-colored carpet of pine-needles and talked of
      many things. Felix spoke at last, in the course of talk, of his going
      away; it was the first time he had alluded to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going away?&rdquo; said Gertrude, looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some day&mdash;when the leaves begin to fall. You know I can&rsquo;t stay
      forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude transferred her eyes to the outer prospect, and then, after a
      pause, she said, &ldquo;I shall never see you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Felix. &ldquo;We shall probably both survive my departure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Gertrude only repeated, &ldquo;I shall never see you again. I shall never
      hear of you,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;I shall know nothing about you. I knew nothing
      about you before, and it will be the same again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew nothing about you then, unfortunately,&rdquo; said Felix. &ldquo;But now I
      shall write to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t write to me. I shall not answer you,&rdquo; Gertrude declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should of course burn your letters,&rdquo; said Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude looked at him again. &ldquo;Burn my letters? You sometimes say strange
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are not strange in themselves,&rdquo; the young man answered. &ldquo;They are
      only strange as said to you. You will come to Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With whom shall I come?&rdquo; She asked this question simply; she was very
      much in earnest. Felix was interested in her earnestness; for some moments
      he hesitated. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell me that,&rdquo; she pursued. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t say that I
      shall go with my father and my sister; you don&rsquo;t believe that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall keep your letters,&rdquo; said Felix, presently, for all answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never write. I don&rsquo;t know how to write.&rdquo; Gertrude, for some time, said
      nothing more; and her companion, as he looked at her, wished it had not
      been &ldquo;disloyal&rdquo; to make love to the daughter of an old gentleman who had
      offered one hospitality. The afternoon waned; the shadows stretched
      themselves; and the light grew deeper in the western sky. Two persons
      appeared on the opposite side of the lake, coming from the house and
      crossing the meadow. &ldquo;It is Charlotte and Mr. Brand,&rdquo; said Gertrude. &ldquo;They
      are coming over here.&rdquo; But Charlotte and Mr. Brand only came down to the
      edge of the water, and stood there, looking across; they made no motion to
      enter the boat that Felix had left at the mooring-place. Felix waved his
      hat to them; it was too far to call. They made no visible response, and
      they presently turned away and walked along the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Brand is not demonstrative,&rdquo; said Felix. &ldquo;He is never demonstrative
      to me. He sits silent, with his chin in his hand, looking at me. Sometimes
      he looks away. Your father tells me he is so eloquent; and I should like
      to hear him talk. He looks like such a noble young man. But with me he
      will never talk. And yet I am so fond of listening to brilliant imagery!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very eloquent,&rdquo; said Gertrude; &ldquo;but he has no brilliant imagery. I
      have heard him talk a great deal. I knew that when they saw us they would
      not come over here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, he is making <i>la cour</i>, as they say, to your sister? They desire to be
      alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Gertrude, gravely, &ldquo;they have no such reason as that for being
      alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why doesn&rsquo;t he make <i>la cour</i> to Charlotte?&rdquo; Felix inquired. &ldquo;She is
      so pretty, so gentle, so good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude glanced at him, and then she looked at the distantly-seen couple
      they were discussing. Mr. Brand and Charlotte were walking side by side.
      They might have been a pair of lovers, and yet they might not. &ldquo;They think
      I should not be here,&rdquo; said Gertrude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With me? I thought you didn&rsquo;t have those ideas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand. There are a great many things you don&rsquo;t
      understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand my stupidity. But why, then, do not Charlotte and Mr. Brand,
      who, as an elder sister and a clergyman, are free to walk about together,
      come over and make me wiser by breaking up the unlawful interview into
      which I have lured you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the last thing they would do,&rdquo; said Gertrude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix stared at her a moment, with his lifted eyebrows. <i>&ldquo;Je n&rsquo;y comprends
      rien!&rdquo;</i> he exclaimed; then his eyes followed for a while the retreating
      figures of this critical pair. &ldquo;You may say what you please,&rdquo; he declared;
      &ldquo;it is evident to me that your sister is not indifferent to her clever
      companion. It is agreeable to her to be walking there with him. I can see
      that from here.&rdquo; And in the excitement of observation Felix rose to his
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude rose also, but she made no attempt to emulate her companion&rsquo;s
      discovery; she looked rather in another direction. Felix&rsquo;s words had
      struck her; but a certain delicacy checked her. &ldquo;She is certainly not
      indifferent to Mr. Brand; she has the highest opinion of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One can see it&mdash;one can see it,&rdquo; said Felix, in a tone of amused
      contemplation, with his head on one side. Gertrude turned her back to the
      opposite shore; it was disagreeable to her to look, but she hoped Felix
      would say something more. &ldquo;Ah, they have wandered away into the wood,&rdquo; he
      added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude turned round again. &ldquo;She is <i>not</i> in love with him,&rdquo; she said; it
      seemed her duty to say that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he is in love with her; or if he is not, he ought to be. She is such
      a perfect little woman of her kind. She reminds me of a pair of
      old-fashioned silver sugar-tongs; you know I am very fond of sugar. And
      she is very nice with Mr. Brand; I have noticed that; very gentle and
      gracious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude reflected a moment. Then she took a great resolution. &ldquo;She wants
      him to marry me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;So of course she is nice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix&rsquo;s eyebrows rose higher than ever. &ldquo;To marry you! Ah, ah, this is
      interesting. And you think one must be very nice with a man to induce him
      to do that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude had turned a little pale, but she went on, &ldquo;Mr. Brand wants it
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix folded his arms and stood looking at her. &ldquo;I see&mdash;I see,&rdquo; he
      said quickly. &ldquo;Why did you never tell me this before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is disagreeable to me to speak of it even now. I wished simply to
      explain to you about Charlotte.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t wish to marry Mr. Brand, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Gertrude, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And does your father wish it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t like him&mdash;you have refused him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to marry him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father and sister think you ought to, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a long story,&rdquo; said Gertrude. &ldquo;They think there are good reasons. I
      can&rsquo;t explain it. They think I have obligations, and that I have
      encouraged him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix smiled at her, as if she had been telling him an amusing story about
      someone else. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you how this interests me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now you
      don&rsquo;t recognize these reasons&mdash;these obligations?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sure; it is not easy.&rdquo; And she picked up her parasol and turned
      away, as if to descend the slope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me this,&rdquo; Felix went on, going with her: &ldquo;are you likely to give in&mdash;to
      let them persuade you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude looked at him with the serious face that she had constantly worn,
      in opposition to his almost eager smile. &ldquo;I shall never marry Mr. Brand,&rdquo;
       she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see!&rdquo; Felix rejoined. And they slowly descended the hill together,
      saying nothing till they reached the margin of the pond. &ldquo;It is your own
      affair,&rdquo; he then resumed; &ldquo;but do you know, I am not altogether glad? If
      it were settled that you were to marry Mr. Brand I should take a certain
      comfort in the arrangement. I should feel more free. I have no right to
      make love to you myself, eh?&rdquo; And he paused, lightly pressing his argument
      upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None whatever,&rdquo; replied Gertrude quickly&mdash;too quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father would never hear of it; I haven&rsquo;t a penny. Mr. Brand, of
      course, has property of his own, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe he has some property; but that has nothing to do with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With you, of course not; but with your father and sister it must have.
      So, as I say, if this were settled, I should feel more at liberty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More at liberty?&rdquo; Gertrude repeated. &ldquo;Please unfasten the boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix untwisted the rope and stood holding it. &ldquo;I should be able to say
      things to you that I can&rsquo;t give myself the pleasure of saying now,&rdquo; he
      went on. &ldquo;I could tell you how much I admire you, without seeming to
      pretend to that which I have no right to pretend to. I should make violent
      love to you,&rdquo; he added, laughing, &ldquo;if I thought you were so placed as not
      to be offended by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean if I were engaged to another man? That is strange reasoning!&rdquo;
       Gertrude exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case you would not take me seriously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take everyone seriously,&rdquo; said Gertrude. And without his help she
      stepped lightly into the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix took up the oars and sent it forward. &ldquo;Ah, this is what you have
      been thinking about? It seemed to me you had something on your mind. I
      wish very much,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that you would tell me some of these so-called
      reasons&mdash;these obligations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are not real reasons&mdash;good reasons,&rdquo; said Gertrude, looking at
      the pink and yellow gleams in the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can understand that! Because a handsome girl has had a spark of
      coquetry, that is no reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you mean me, it&rsquo;s not that. I have not done that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is something that troubles you, at any rate,&rdquo; said Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so much as it used to,&rdquo; Gertrude rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her, smiling always. &ldquo;That is not saying much, eh?&rdquo; But she
      only rested her eyes, very gravely, on the lighted water. She seemed to
      him to be trying to hide the signs of the trouble of which she had just
      told him. Felix felt, at all times, much the same impulse to dissipate
      visible melancholy that a good housewife feels to brush away dust. There
      was something he wished to brush away now; suddenly he stopped rowing and
      poised his oars. &ldquo;Why should Mr. Brand have addressed himself to you, and
      not to your sister?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I am sure she would listen to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude, in her family, was thought capable of a good deal of levity; but
      her levity had never gone so far as this. It moved her greatly, however,
      to hear Felix say that he was sure of something; so that, raising her eyes
      toward him, she tried intently, for some moments, to conjure up this
      wonderful image of a love-affair between her own sister and her own
      suitor. We know that Gertrude had an imaginative mind; so that it is not
      impossible that this effort should have been partially successful. But she
      only murmured, &ldquo;Ah, Felix! ah, Felix!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t they marry? Try and make them marry!&rdquo; cried Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try and make them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn the tables on them. Then they will leave you alone. I will help you
      as far as I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude&rsquo;s heart began to beat; she was greatly excited; she had never had
      anything so interesting proposed to her before. Felix had begun to row
      again, and he now sent the boat home with long strokes. &ldquo;I believe she
      <i>does</i> care for him!&rdquo; said Gertrude, after they had disembarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course she does, and we will marry them off. It will make them happy;
      it will make everyone happy. We shall have a wedding and I will write an
      epithalamium.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems as if it would make <i>me</i> happy,&rdquo; said Gertrude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To get rid of Mr. Brand, eh? To recover your liberty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude walked on. &ldquo;To see my sister married to so good a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix gave his light laugh. &ldquo;You always put things on those grounds; you
      will never say anything for yourself. You are all so afraid, here, of
      being selfish. I don&rsquo;t think you know how,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Let me show you!
      It will make me happy for myself, and for just the reverse of what I told
      you a while ago. After that, when I make love to you, you will have to
      think I mean it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never think you mean anything,&rdquo; said Gertrude. &ldquo;You are too
      fantastic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; cried Felix, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a license to say everything! Gertrude, I adore
      you!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Charlotte and Mr. Brand had not returned when they reached the house; but
      the Baroness had come to tea, and Robert Acton also, who now regularly
      asked for a place at this generous repast or made his appearance later in
      the evening. Clifford Wentworth, with his juvenile growl, remarked upon
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are always coming to tea nowadays, Robert,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I should think
      you had drunk enough tea in China.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since when is Mr. Acton more frequent?&rdquo; asked the Baroness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you came,&rdquo; said Clifford. &ldquo;It seems as if you were a kind of
      attraction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I am a curiosity,&rdquo; said the Baroness. &ldquo;Give me time and I will
      make you a salon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would fall to pieces after you go!&rdquo; exclaimed Acton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk about her going, in that familiar way,&rdquo; Clifford said. &ldquo;It
      makes me feel gloomy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wentworth glanced at his son, and taking note of these words, wondered
      if Felix had been teaching him, according to the programme he had sketched
      out, to make love to the wife of a German prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charlotte came in late with Mr. Brand; but Gertrude, to whom, at least,
      Felix had taught something, looked in vain, in her face, for the traces of
      a guilty passion. Mr. Brand sat down by Gertrude, and she presently asked
      him why they had not crossed the pond to join Felix and herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is cruel of you to ask me that,&rdquo; he answered, very softly. He had a
      large morsel of cake before him; but he fingered it without eating it. &ldquo;I
      sometimes think you are growing cruel,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude said nothing; she was afraid to speak. There was a kind of rage
      in her heart; she felt as if she could easily persuade herself that she
      was persecuted. She said to herself that it was quite right that she
      should not allow him to make her believe she was wrong. She thought of
      what Felix had said to her; she wished indeed Mr. Brand would marry
      Charlotte. She looked away from him and spoke no more. Mr. Brand ended by
      eating his cake, while Felix sat opposite, describing to Mr. Wentworth the
      students&rsquo; duels at Heidelberg. After tea they all dispersed themselves, as
      usual, upon the piazza and in the garden; and Mr. Brand drew near to
      Gertrude again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t come to you this afternoon because you were not alone,&rdquo; he
      began; &ldquo;because you were with a newer friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Felix? He is an old friend by this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brand looked at the ground for some moments. &ldquo;I thought I was prepared
      to hear you speak in that way,&rdquo; he resumed. &ldquo;But I find it very painful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what else I can say,&rdquo; said Gertrude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brand walked beside her for a while in silence; Gertrude wished he
      would go away. &ldquo;He is certainly very accomplished. But I think I ought to
      advise you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To advise me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I know your nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Gertrude, with a soft laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make yourself out worse than you are&mdash;to please him,&rdquo; Mr. Brand
      said, gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse&mdash;to please him? What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Gertrude, stopping.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brand stopped also, and with the same soft straight-forwardness, &ldquo;He
      doesn&rsquo;t care for the things you care for&mdash;the great questions of
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude, with her eyes on his, shook her head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for the
      great questions of life. They are much beyond me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a time when you didn&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; said Mr. Brand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; rejoined Gertrude, &ldquo;I think you made me talk a great deal of
      nonsense. And it depends,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;upon what you call the great
      questions of life. There are some things I care for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they the things you talk about with your cousin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should not say things to me against my cousin, Mr. Brand,&rdquo; said
      Gertrude. &ldquo;That is dishonorable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He listened to this respectfully; then he answered, with a little
      vibration of the voice, &ldquo;I should be very sorry to do anything
      dishonorable. But I don&rsquo;t see why it is dishonorable to say that your
      cousin is frivolous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and say it to himself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he would admit it,&rdquo; said Mr. Brand. &ldquo;That is the tone he would
      take. He would not be ashamed of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I am not ashamed of it!&rdquo; Gertrude declared. &ldquo;That is probably what I
      like him for. I am frivolous myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are trying, as I said just now, to lower yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am trying for once to be natural!&rdquo; cried Gertrude passionately. &ldquo;I have
      been pretending, all my life; I have been dishonest; it is you that have
      made me so!&rdquo; Mr. Brand stood gazing at her, and she went on, &ldquo;Why
      shouldn&rsquo;t I be frivolous, if I want? One has a right to be frivolous, if it&rsquo;s
      one&rsquo;s nature. No, I don&rsquo;t care for the great questions. I care for
      pleasure&mdash;for amusement. Perhaps I am fond of wicked things; it is
      very possible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brand remained staring; he was even a little pale, as if he had been
      frightened. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you know what you are saying!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not. Perhaps I am talking nonsense. But it is only with you that
      I talk nonsense. I never do so with my cousin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will speak to you again, when you are less excited,&rdquo; said Mr. Brand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am always excited when you speak to me. I must tell you that&mdash;even
      if it prevents you altogether, in future. Your speaking to me irritates
      me. With my cousin it is very different. That seems quiet and natural.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her, and then he looked away, with a kind of helpless
      distress, at the dusky garden and the faint summer stars. After which,
      suddenly turning back, &ldquo;Gertrude, Gertrude!&rdquo; he softly groaned. &ldquo;Am I
      really losing you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was touched&mdash;she was pained; but it had already occurred to her
      that she might do something better than say so. It would not have
      alleviated her companion&rsquo;s distress to perceive, just then, whence she had
      sympathetically borrowed this ingenuity. &ldquo;I am not sorry for you,&rdquo;
       Gertrude said; &ldquo;for in paying so much attention to me you are following a
      shadow&mdash;you are wasting something precious. There is something else
      you might have that you don&rsquo;t look at&mdash;something better than I am.
      That is a reality!&rdquo; And then, with intention, she looked at him and tried
      to smile a little. He thought this smile of hers very strange; but she
      turned away and left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wandered about alone in the garden wondering what Mr. Brand would make
      of her words, which it had been a singular pleasure for her to utter.
      Shortly after, passing in front of the house, she saw at a distance two
      persons standing near the garden gate. It was Mr. Brand going away and
      bidding good-night to Charlotte, who had walked down with him from the
      house. Gertrude saw that the parting was prolonged. Then she turned her
      back upon it. She had not gone very far, however, when she heard her
      sister slowly following her. She neither turned round nor waited for her;
      she knew what Charlotte was going to say. Charlotte, who at last overtook
      her, in fact presently began; she had passed her arm into Gertrude&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you listen to me, dear, if I say something very particular?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what you are going to say,&rdquo; said Gertrude. &ldquo;Mr. Brand feels very
      badly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Gertrude, how can you treat him so?&rdquo; Charlotte demanded. And as her
      sister made no answer she added, &ldquo;After all he has done for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has he done for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder you can ask, Gertrude. He has helped you so. You told me so
      yourself, a great many times. You told me that he helped you to struggle
      with your&mdash;your peculiarities. You told me that he had taught you how
      to govern your temper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Gertrude said nothing. Then, &ldquo;Was my temper very bad?&rdquo; she
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not accusing you, Gertrude,&rdquo; said Charlotte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing, then?&rdquo; her sister demanded, with a short laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am pleading for Mr. Brand&mdash;reminding you of all you owe him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have given it all back,&rdquo; said Gertrude, still with her little laugh.
      &ldquo;He can take back the virtue he imparted! I want to be wicked again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her sister made her stop in the path, and fixed upon her, in the darkness,
      a sweet, reproachful gaze. &ldquo;If you talk this way I shall almost believe
      it. Think of all we owe Mr. Brand. Think of how he has always expected
      something of you. Think how much he has been to us. Think of his beautiful
      influence upon Clifford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very good,&rdquo; said Gertrude, looking at her sister. &ldquo;I know he is
      very good. But he shouldn&rsquo;t speak against Felix.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Felix is good,&rdquo; Charlotte answered, softly but promptly. &ldquo;Felix is very
      wonderful. Only he is so different. Mr. Brand is much nearer to us. I
      should never think of going to Felix with a trouble&mdash;with a question.
      Mr. Brand is much more to us, Gertrude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very&mdash;very good,&rdquo; Gertrude repeated. &ldquo;He is more to you; yes,
      much more. Charlotte,&rdquo; she added suddenly, &ldquo;you are in love with him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Gertrude!&rdquo; cried poor Charlotte; and her sister saw her blushing in
      the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude put her arm round her. &ldquo;I wish he would marry you!&rdquo; she went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charlotte shook herself free. &ldquo;You must not say such things!&rdquo; she
      exclaimed, beneath her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You like him more than you say, and he likes you more than he knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is very cruel of you!&rdquo; Charlotte Wentworth murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if it was cruel Gertrude continued pitiless. &ldquo;Not if it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; she
      answered. &ldquo;I wish he would marry you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t say that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to tell him so!&rdquo; said Gertrude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Gertrude, Gertrude!&rdquo; her sister almost moaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if he speaks to me again about myself. I will say, &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you
      marry Charlotte? She&rsquo;s a thousand times better than I.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>are</i> wicked; you <i>are</i> changed!&rdquo; cried her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t like it you can prevent it,&rdquo; said Gertrude. &ldquo;You can prevent
      it by keeping him from speaking to me!&rdquo; And with this she walked away,
      very conscious of what she had done; measuring it and finding a certain
      joy and a quickened sense of freedom in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wentworth was rather wide of the mark in suspecting that Clifford had
      begun to pay unscrupulous compliments to his brilliant cousin; for the
      young man had really more scruples than he received credit for in his
      family. He had a certain transparent shamefacedness which was in itself a
      proof that he was not at his ease in dissipation. His collegiate
      peccadilloes had aroused a domestic murmur as disagreeable to the young
      man as the creaking of his boots would have been to a house-breaker. Only,
      as the house-breaker would have simplified matters by removing his
      <i>chaussures</i>, it had seemed to Clifford that the shortest cut to comfortable
      relations with people&mdash;relations which should make him cease to think
      that when they spoke to him they meant something improving&mdash;was to
      renounce all ambition toward a nefarious development. And, in fact,
      Clifford&rsquo;s ambition took the most commendable form. He thought of himself
      in the future as the well-known and much-liked Mr. Wentworth, of Boston,
      who should, in the natural course of prosperity, have married his pretty
      cousin, Lizzie Acton; should live in a wide-fronted house, in view of the
      Common; and should drive, behind a light wagon, over the damp autumn
      roads, a pair of beautifully matched sorrel horses. Clifford&rsquo;s vision of
      the coming years was very simple; its most definite features were this
      element of familiar matrimony and the duplication of his resources for
      trotting. He had not yet asked his cousin to marry him; but he meant to do
      so as soon as he had taken his degree. Lizzie was serenely conscious of
      his intention, and she had made up her mind that he would improve. Her
      brother, who was very fond of this light, quick, competent little Lizzie,
      saw on his side no reason to interpose. It seemed to him a graceful social
      law that Clifford and his sister should become engaged; he himself was not
      engaged, but everyone else, fortunately, was not such a fool as he. He
      was fond of Clifford, as well, and had his own way&mdash;of which it must
      be confessed he was a little ashamed&mdash;of looking at those aberrations
      which had led to the young man&rsquo;s compulsory retirement from the
      neighboring seat of learning. Acton had seen the world, as he said to
      himself; he had been to China and had knocked about among men. He had
      learned the essential difference between a nice young fellow and a mean
      young fellow, and was satisfied that there was no harm in Clifford. He
      believed&mdash;although it must be added that he had not quite the courage
      to declare it&mdash;in the doctrine of wild oats, and thought it a useful
      preventive of superfluous fears. If Mr. Wentworth and Charlotte and Mr.
      Brand would only apply it in Clifford&rsquo;s case, they would be happier; and
      Acton thought it a pity they should not be happier. They took the boy&rsquo;s
      misdemeanors too much to heart; they talked to him too solemnly; they
      frightened and bewildered him. Of course there was the great standard of
      morality, which forbade that a man should get tipsy, play at billiards for
      money, or cultivate his sensual consciousness; but what fear was there
      that poor Clifford was going to run a tilt at any great standard? It had,
      however, never occurred to Acton to dedicate the Baroness Münster to the
      redemption of a refractory collegian. The instrument, here, would have
      seemed to him quite too complex for the operation. Felix, on the other
      hand, had spoken in obedience to the belief that the more charming a woman
      is the more numerous, literally, are her definite social uses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eugenia herself, as we know, had plenty of leisure to enumerate her uses.
      As I have had the honor of intimating, she had come four thousand miles to
      seek her fortune; and it is not to be supposed that after this great
      effort she could neglect any apparent aid to advancement. It is my
      misfortune that in attempting to describe in a short compass the
      deportment of this remarkable woman I am obliged to express things rather
      brutally. I feel this to be the case, for instance, when I say that she
      had primarily detected such an aid to advancement in the person of Robert
      Acton, but that she had afterwards remembered that a prudent archer has
      always a second bowstring. Eugenia was a woman of finely-mingled motive,
      and her intentions were never sensibly gross. She had a sort of aesthetic
      ideal for Clifford which seemed to her a disinterested reason for taking
      him in hand. It was very well for a fresh-colored young gentleman to be
      ingenuous; but Clifford, really, was crude. With such a pretty face he
      ought to have prettier manners. She would teach him that, with a beautiful
      name, the expectation of a large property, and, as they said in Europe, a
      social position, an only son should know how to carry himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once Clifford had begun to come and see her by himself and for himself, he
      came very often. He hardly knew why he should come; he saw her almost
      every evening at his father&rsquo;s house; he had nothing particular to say to
      her. She was not a young girl, and fellows of his age called only upon
      young girls. He exaggerated her age; she seemed to him an old woman; it
      was happy that the Baroness, with all her intelligence, was incapable of
      guessing this. But gradually it struck Clifford that visiting old women
      might be, if not a natural, at least, as they say of some articles of
      diet, an acquired taste. The Baroness was certainly a very amusing old
      woman; she talked to him as no lady&mdash;and indeed no gentleman&mdash;had
      ever talked to him before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should go to Europe and make the tour,&rdquo; she said to him one
      afternoon. &ldquo;Of course, on leaving college you will go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go,&rdquo; Clifford declared. &ldquo;I know some fellows who have
      been to Europe. They say you can have better fun here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends. It depends upon your idea of fun. Your friends probably
      were not introduced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Introduced?&rdquo; Clifford demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They had no opportunity of going into society; they formed no <i>relations</i>.&rdquo;
       This was one of a certain number of words that the Baroness often
      pronounced in the French manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They went to a ball, in Paris; I know that,&rdquo; said Clifford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, there are balls and balls; especially in Paris. No, you must go, you
      know; it is not a thing from which you can dispense yourself. You need
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m very well,&rdquo; said Clifford. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean for your health, my poor child. I mean for your manners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got any manners!&rdquo; growled Clifford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. You don&rsquo;t mind my assenting to that, eh?&rdquo; asked the Baroness
      with a smile. &ldquo;You must go to Europe and get a few. You can get them
      better there. It is a pity you might not have come while I was living in&mdash;in
      Germany. I would have introduced you; I had a charming little circle. You
      would perhaps have been rather young; but the younger one begins, I think,
      the better. Now, at any rate, you have no time to lose, and when I return
      you must immediately come to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this, to Clifford&rsquo;s apprehension, was a great mixture&mdash;his
      beginning young, Eugenia&rsquo;s return to Europe, his being introduced to her
      charming little circle. What was he to begin, and what was her little
      circle? His ideas about her marriage had a good deal of vagueness; but
      they were in so far definite as that he felt it to be a matter not to be
      freely mentioned. He sat and looked all round the room; he supposed she
      was alluding in some way to her marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t want to go to Germany,&rdquo; he said; it seemed to him the most
      convenient thing to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him a while, smiling with her lips, but not with her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have scruples?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scruples?&rdquo; said Clifford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You young people, here, are very singular; one doesn&rsquo;t know where to
      expect you. When you are not extremely improper you are so terribly
      proper. I dare say you think that, owing to my irregular marriage, I live
      with loose people. You were never more mistaken. I have been all the more
      particular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Clifford, honestly distressed. &ldquo;I never thought such a
      thing as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you very sure? I am convinced that your father does, and your
      sisters. They say to each other that here I am on my good behavior, but
      that over there&mdash;married by the left hand&mdash;I associate with
      light women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; cried Clifford, energetically, &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t say such things as
      that to each other!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they think them they had better say them,&rdquo; the Baroness rejoined.
      &ldquo;Then they can be contradicted. Please contradict that whenever you hear
      it, and don&rsquo;t be afraid of coming to see me on account of the company I
      keep. I have the honor of knowing more distinguished men, my poor child,
      than you are likely to see in a life-time. I see very few women; but those
      are women of rank. So, my dear young Puritan, you needn&rsquo;t be afraid. I am
      not in the least one of those who think that the society of women who have
      lost their place in the <i>vrai monde</i> is necessary to form a young man. I
      have never taken that tone. I have kept my place myself, and I think we
      are a much better school than the others. Trust me, Clifford, and I will
      prove that to you,&rdquo; the Baroness continued, while she made the agreeable
      reflection that she could not, at least, be accused of perverting her
      young kinsman. &ldquo;So if you ever fall among thieves don&rsquo;t go about saying I
      sent you to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clifford thought it so comical that he should know&mdash;in spite of her
      figurative language&mdash;what she meant, and that she should mean what he
      knew, that he could hardly help laughing a little, although he tried hard.
      &ldquo;Oh, no! oh, no!&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laugh out, laugh out, if I amuse you!&rdquo; cried the Baroness. &ldquo;I am here for
      that!&rdquo; And Clifford thought her a very amusing person indeed. &ldquo;But
      remember,&rdquo; she said on this occasion, &ldquo;that you are coming&mdash;next year&mdash;to
      pay me a visit over there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      About a week afterwards she said to him, point-blank, &ldquo;Are you seriously
      making love to your little cousin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seriously making love&rdquo;&mdash;these words, on Madame Münster&rsquo;s lips, had
      to Clifford&rsquo;s sense a portentous and embarrassing sound; he hesitated
      about assenting, lest he should commit himself to more than he understood.
      &ldquo;Well, I shouldn&rsquo;t say it if I was!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t you say it?&rdquo; the Baroness demanded. &ldquo;Those things ought to
      be known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care whether it is known or not,&rdquo; Clifford rejoined. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t
      want people looking at me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A young man of your importance ought to learn to bear observation&mdash;to
      carry himself as if he were quite indifferent to it. I won&rsquo;t say, exactly,
      unconscious,&rdquo; the Baroness explained. &ldquo;No, he must seem to know he is
      observed, and to think it natural he should be; but he must appear
      perfectly used to it. Now you haven&rsquo;t that, Clifford; you haven&rsquo;t that
      at all. You must have that, you know. Don&rsquo;t tell me you are not a young
      man of importance,&rdquo; Eugenia added. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say anything so flat as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, you don&rsquo;t catch me saying that!&rdquo; cried Clifford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you must come to Germany,&rdquo; Madame Münster continued. &ldquo;I will show
      you how people can be talked about, and yet not seem to know it. You will
      be talked about, of course, with me; it will be said you are my lover. I
      will show you how little one may mind that&mdash;how little I shall mind
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clifford sat staring, blushing and laughing. &ldquo;I shall mind it a good
      deal!&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, not too much, you know; that would be uncivil. But I give you leave
      to mind it a little; especially if you have a passion for Miss Acton.
      <i>Voyons</i>; as regards that, you either have or you have not. It is very
      simple to say it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you want to know,&rdquo; said Clifford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to want me to know. If one is arranging a marriage, one tells
      one&rsquo;s friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not arranging anything,&rdquo; said Clifford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t intend to marry your cousin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I expect I shall do as I choose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness leaned her head upon the back of her chair and closed her
      eyes, as if she were tired. Then opening them again, &ldquo;Your cousin is very
      charming!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is the prettiest girl in this place,&rdquo; Clifford rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;In this place&rsquo; is saying little; she would be charming anywhere. I am
      afraid you are entangled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, I&rsquo;m not entangled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you engaged? At your age that is the same thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clifford looked at the Baroness with some audacity. &ldquo;Will you tell no
      one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s as sacred as that&mdash;no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then&mdash;we are not!&rdquo; said Clifford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the great secret&mdash;that you are not, eh?&rdquo; asked the Baroness,
      with a quick laugh. &ldquo;I am very glad to hear it. You are altogether too
      young. A young man in your position must choose and compare; he must see
      the world first. Depend upon it,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;you should not settle that
      matter before you have come abroad and paid me that visit. There are
      several things I should like to call your attention to first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am rather afraid of that visit,&rdquo; said Clifford. &ldquo;It seems to me
      it will be rather like going to school again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness looked at him a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there is no agreeable man who has not, at some
      moment, been to school to a clever woman&mdash;probably a little older
      than himself. And you must be thankful when you get your instructions
      gratis. With me you would get it gratis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day Clifford told Lizzie Acton that the Baroness thought her the
      most charming girl she had ever seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lizzie shook her head. &ldquo;No, she doesn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think everything she says,&rdquo; asked Clifford, &ldquo;is to be taken the
      opposite way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that is!&rdquo; said Lizzie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clifford was going to remark that in this case the Baroness must desire
      greatly to bring about a marriage between Mr. Clifford Wentworth and Miss
      Elizabeth Acton; but he resolved, on the whole, to suppress this
      observation.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      It seemed to Robert Acton, after Eugenia had come to his house, that
      something had passed between them which made them a good deal more
      intimate. It was hard to say exactly what, except her telling him that she
      had taken her resolution with regard to the Prince Adolf; for Madame
      Münster&rsquo;s visit had made no difference in their relations. He came to see
      her very often; but he had come to see her very often before. It was
      agreeable to him to find himself in her little drawing-room; but this was
      not a new discovery. There was a change, however, in this sense: that if
      the Baroness had been a great deal in Acton&rsquo;s thoughts before, she was now
      never out of them. From the first she had been personally fascinating; but
      the fascination now had become intellectual as well. He was constantly
      pondering her words and motions; they were as interesting as the factors
      in an algebraic problem. This is saying a good deal; for Acton was
      extremely fond of mathematics. He asked himself whether it could be that
      he was in love with her, and then hoped he was not; hoped it not so much
      for his own sake as for that of the amatory passion itself. If this was
      love, love had been overrated. Love was a poetic impulse, and his own
      state of feeling with regard to the Baroness was largely characterized by
      that eminently prosaic sentiment&mdash;curiosity. It was true, as Acton
      with his quietly cogitative habit observed to himself, that curiosity,
      pushed to a given point, might become a romantic passion; and he certainly
      thought enough about this charming woman to make him restless and even a
      little melancholy. It puzzled and vexed him at times to feel that he was
      not more ardent. He was not in the least bent upon remaining a bachelor.
      In his younger years he had been&mdash;or he had tried to be&mdash;of the
      opinion that it would be a good deal &ldquo;jollier&rdquo; not to marry, and he had
      flattered himself that his single condition was something of a citadel. It
      was a citadel, at all events, of which he had long since leveled the
      outworks. He had removed the guns from the ramparts; he had lowered the
      draw-bridge across the moat. The draw-bridge had swayed lightly under
      Madame Münster&rsquo;s step; why should he not cause it to be raised again, so
      that she might be kept prisoner? He had an idea that she would become&mdash;in
      time at least, and on learning the conveniences of the place for making a
      lady comfortable&mdash;a tolerably patient captive. But the draw-bridge
      was never raised, and Acton&rsquo;s brilliant visitor was as free to depart as
      she had been to come. It was part of his curiosity to know why the deuce
      so susceptible a man was <i>not</i> in love with so charming a woman. If her
      various graces were, as I have said, the factors in an algebraic problem,
      the answer to this question was the indispensable unknown quantity. The
      pursuit of the unknown quantity was extremely absorbing; for the present
      it taxed all Acton&rsquo;s faculties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward the middle of August he was obliged to leave home for some days; an
      old friend, with whom he had been associated in China, had begged him to
      come to Newport, where he lay extremely ill. His friend got better, and at
      the end of a week Acton was released. I use the word &ldquo;released&rdquo; advisedly;
      for in spite of his attachment to his Chinese comrade he had been but a
      half-hearted visitor. He felt as if he had been called away from the
      theatre during the progress of a remarkably interesting drama. The curtain
      was up all this time, and he was losing the fourth act; that fourth act
      which would have been so essential to a just appreciation of the fifth. In
      other words, he was thinking about the Baroness, who, seen at this
      distance, seemed a truly brilliant figure. He saw at Newport a great many
      pretty women, who certainly were figures as brilliant as beautiful light
      dresses could make them; but though they talked a great deal&mdash;and the
      Baroness&rsquo;s strong point was perhaps also her conversation&mdash;Madame
      Münster appeared to lose nothing by the comparison. He wished she had come
      to Newport too. Would it not be possible to make up, as they said, a party
      for visiting the famous watering-place and invite Eugenia to join it? It
      was true that the complete satisfaction would be to spend a fortnight at
      Newport with Eugenia alone. It would be a great pleasure to see her, in
      society, carry everything before her, as he was sure she would do. When
      Acton caught himself thinking these thoughts he began to walk up and down,
      with his hands in his pockets, frowning a little and looking at the floor.
      What did it prove&mdash;for it certainly proved something&mdash;this
      lively disposition to be &ldquo;off&rdquo; somewhere with Madame Münster, away from
      all the rest of them? Such a vision, certainly, seemed a refined
      implication of matrimony, after the Baroness should have formally got rid
      of her informal husband. At any rate, Acton, with his characteristic
      discretion, forbore to give expression to whatever else it might imply,
      and the narrator of these incidents is not obliged to be more definite.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned home rapidly, and, arriving in the afternoon, lost as little
      time as possible in joining the familiar circle at Mr. Wentworth&rsquo;s. On
      reaching the house, however, he found the piazzas empty. The doors and
      windows were open, and their emptiness was made clear by the shafts of
      lamp-light from the parlors. Entering the house, he found Mr. Wentworth
      sitting alone in one of these apartments, engaged in the perusal of the
      <i>North American Review</i>. After they had exchanged greetings and his cousin
      had made discreet inquiry about his journey, Acton asked what had become
      of Mr. Wentworth&rsquo;s companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are scattered about, amusing themselves as usual,&rdquo; said the old man.
      &ldquo;I saw Charlotte, a short time since, seated, with Mr. Brand, upon the
      piazza. They were conversing with their customary animation. I suppose
      they have joined her sister, who, for the hundredth time, was doing the
      honors of the garden to her foreign cousin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you mean Felix,&rdquo; said Acton. And on Mr. Wentworth&rsquo;s assenting,
      he said, &ldquo;And the others?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sister has not come this evening. You must have seen her at home,&rdquo;
       said Mr. Wentworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I proposed to her to come. She declined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lizzie, I suppose, was expecting a visitor,&rdquo; said the old man, with a
      kind of solemn slyness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she was expecting Clifford, he had not turned up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wentworth, at this intelligence, closed the <i>North American Review</i>
      and remarked that he had understood Clifford to say that he was going to
      see his cousin. Privately, he reflected that if Lizzie Acton had had no
      news of his son, Clifford must have gone to Boston for the evening: an
      unnatural course of a summer night, especially when accompanied with
      disingenuous representations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must remember that he has two cousins,&rdquo; said Acton, laughing. And
      then, coming to the point, &ldquo;If Lizzie is not here,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;neither
      apparently is the Baroness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wentworth stared a moment, and remembered that queer proposition of
      Felix&rsquo;s. For a moment he did not know whether it was not to be wished that
      Clifford, after all, might have gone to Boston. &ldquo;The Baroness has not
      honored us tonight,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She has not come over for three days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she ill?&rdquo; Acton asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I have been to see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Wentworth, &ldquo;I infer she has tired of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Acton pretended to sit down, but he was restless; he found it impossible
      to talk with Mr. Wentworth. At the end of ten minutes he took up his hat
      and said that he thought he would &ldquo;go off.&rdquo; It was very late; it was ten
      o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      His quiet-faced kinsman looked at him a moment. &ldquo;Are you going home?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Acton hesitated, and then answered that he had proposed to go over and
      take a look at the Baroness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you are honest, at least,&rdquo; said Mr. Wentworth, sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So are you, if you come to that!&rdquo; cried Acton, laughing. &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t
      I be honest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man opened the <i>North American</i> again, and read a few lines. &ldquo;If
      we have ever had any virtue among us, we had better keep hold of it now,&rdquo;
       he said. He was not quoting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have a Baroness among us,&rdquo; said Acton. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we must keep hold
      of!&rdquo; He was too impatient to see Madame Münster again to wonder what Mr.
      Wentworth was talking about. Nevertheless, after he had passed out of the
      house and traversed the garden and the little piece of road that separated
      him from Eugenia&rsquo;s provisional residence, he stopped a moment outside. He
      stood in her little garden; the long window of her parlor was open, and he
      could see the white curtains, with the lamp-light shining through them,
      swaying softly to and fro in the warm night wind. There was a sort of
      excitement in the idea of seeing Madame Münster again; he became aware
      that his heart was beating rather faster than usual. It was this that made
      him stop, with a half-amused surprise. But in a moment he went along the
      piazza, and, approaching the open window, tapped upon its lintel with his
      stick. He could see the Baroness within; she was standing in the middle of
      the room. She came to the window and pulled aside the curtain; then she
      stood looking at him a moment. She was not smiling; she seemed serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Mais entrez donc!&rdquo;</i> she said at last. Acton passed in across the
      window-sill; he wondered, for an instant, what was the matter with her.
      But the next moment she had begun to smile and had put out her hand.
      &ldquo;Better late than never,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is very kind of you to come at
      this hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just returned from my journey,&rdquo; said Acton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, very kind, very kind,&rdquo; she repeated, looking about her where to sit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went first to the other house,&rdquo; Acton continued. &ldquo;I expected to find
      you there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had sunk into her usual chair; but she got up again, and began to move
      about the room. Acton had laid down his hat and stick; he was looking at
      her, conscious that there was in fact a great charm in seeing her again.
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I ought to tell you to sit down,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is
      too late to begin a visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too early to end one,&rdquo; Acton declared; &ldquo;and we needn&rsquo;t mind the
      beginning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him again, and, after a moment, dropped once more into her
      low chair, while he took a place near her. &ldquo;We are in the middle, then?&rdquo;
       she asked. &ldquo;Was that where we were when you went away? No, I haven&rsquo;t been
      to the other house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yesterday, nor the day before, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how many days it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are tired of it,&rdquo; said Acton.
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned back in her chair; her arms were folded. &ldquo;That is a terrible
      accusation, but I have not the courage to defend myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not attacking you,&rdquo; said Acton. &ldquo;I expected something of this kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a proof of extreme intelligence. I hope you enjoyed your journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Acton declared. &ldquo;I would much rather have been here with
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you <i>are</i> attacking me,&rdquo; said the Baroness. &ldquo;You are contrasting my
      inconstancy with your own fidelity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess I never get tired of people I like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you are not a poor wicked foreign woman, with irritable nerves and a
      sophisticated mind!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something has happened to you since I went away,&rdquo; said Acton, changing
      his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your going away&mdash;that is what has happened to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say that you have missed me?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had meant to say it, it would not be worth your making a note of. I
      am very dishonest and my compliments are worthless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Acton was silent for some moments. &ldquo;You have broken down,&rdquo; he said at
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Münster left her chair, and began to move about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only for a moment. I shall pull myself together again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better not take it too hard. If you are bored, you needn&rsquo;t be
      afraid to say so&mdash;to me at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t say such things as that,&rdquo; the Baroness answered. &ldquo;You
      should encourage me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admire your patience; that is encouraging.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t even say that. When you talk of my patience you are
      disloyal to your own people. Patience implies suffering; and what have I
      had to suffer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not hunger, not unkindness, certainly,&rdquo; said Acton, laughing.
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, we all admire your patience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You all detest me!&rdquo; cried the Baroness, with a sudden vehemence, turning
      her back toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make it hard,&rdquo; said Acton, getting up, &ldquo;for a man to say something
      tender to you.&rdquo; This evening there was something particularly striking and
      touching about her; an unwonted softness and a look of suppressed emotion.
      He felt himself suddenly appreciating the fact that she had behaved very
      well. She had come to this quiet corner of the world under the weight of a
      cruel indignity, and she had been so gracefully, modestly thankful for the
      rest she found there. She had joined that simple circle over the way; she
      had mingled in its plain, provincial talk; she had shared its meagre and
      savorless pleasures. She had set herself a task, and she had rigidly
      performed it. She had conformed to the angular conditions of New England
      life, and she had had the tact and pluck to carry it off as if she liked
      them. Acton felt a more downright need than he had ever felt before to
      tell her that he admired her and that she struck him as a very superior
      woman. All along, hitherto, he had been on his guard with her; he had been
      cautious, observant, suspicious. But now a certain light tumult in his
      blood seemed to tell him that a finer degree of confidence in this
      charming woman would be its own reward. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t detest you,&rdquo; he went on.
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean. At any rate, I speak for myself; I don&rsquo;t know
      anything about the others. Very likely, you detest them for the dull life
      they make you lead. Really, it would give me a sort of pleasure to hear
      you say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenia had been looking at the door on the other side of the room; now
      she slowly turned her eyes toward Robert Acton. &ldquo;What can be the motive,&rdquo;
       she asked, &ldquo;of a man like you&mdash;an honest man, a
      <i>galant homme</i>&mdash;in saying so base a thing as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it sound very base?&rdquo; asked Acton, candidly. &ldquo;I suppose it does, and
      I thank you for telling me so. Of course, I don&rsquo;t mean it literally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness stood looking at him. &ldquo;How do you mean it?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      This question was difficult to answer, and Acton, feeling the least bit
      foolish, walked to the open window and looked out. He stood there,
      thinking a moment, and then he turned back. &ldquo;You know that document that
      you were to send to Germany,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You called it your &lsquo;renunciation.&rsquo; 
      Did you ever send it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Münster&rsquo;s eyes expanded; she looked very grave. &ldquo;What a singular
      answer to my question!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t an answer,&rdquo; said Acton. &ldquo;I have wished to ask you, many
      times. I thought it probable you would tell me yourself. The question, on
      my part, seems abrupt now; but it would be abrupt at any time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness was silent a moment; and then, &ldquo;I think I have told you too
      much!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      This declaration appeared to Acton to have a certain force; he had indeed
      a sense of asking more of her than he offered her. He returned to the
      window, and watched, for a moment, a little star that twinkled through the
      lattice of the piazza. There were at any rate offers enough he could make;
      perhaps he had hitherto not been sufficiently explicit in doing so. &ldquo;I
      wish you would ask something of me,&rdquo; he presently said. &ldquo;Is there nothing
      I can do for you? If you can&rsquo;t stand this dull life any more, let me amuse
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness had sunk once more into a chair, and she had taken up a fan
      which she held, with both hands, to her mouth. Over the top of the fan her
      eyes were fixed on him. &ldquo;You are very strange tonight,&rdquo; she said, with a
      little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do anything in the world,&rdquo; he rejoined, standing in front of her.
      &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t you like to travel about and see something of the country?
      Won&rsquo;t you go to Niagara? You ought to see Niagara, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With you, do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be delighted to take you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Acton looked at her, smiling, and yet with a serious air. &ldquo;Well, yes; we
      might go alone,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were not what you are,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I should feel insulted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean&mdash;what I am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were one of the gentlemen I have been used to all my life. If you
      were not a queer Bostonian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the gentlemen you have been used to have taught you to expect
      insults,&rdquo; said Acton, &ldquo;I am glad I am what I am. You had much better come
      to Niagara.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wish to &lsquo;amuse&rsquo; me,&rdquo; the Baroness declared, &ldquo;you need go to no
      further expense. You amuse me very effectually.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down opposite to her; she still held her fan up to her face, with
      her eyes only showing above it. There was a moment&rsquo;s silence, and then he
      said, returning to his former question, &ldquo;Have you sent that document to
      Germany?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again there was a moment&rsquo;s silence. The expressive eyes of Madame Münster
      seemed, however, half to break it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you&mdash;at Niagara!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had hardly spoken when the door at the further end of the room opened&mdash;the
      door upon which, some minutes previous, Eugenia had fixed her gaze.
      Clifford Wentworth stood there, blushing and looking rather awkward. The
      Baroness rose, quickly, and Acton, more slowly, did the same. Clifford
      gave him no greeting; he was looking at Eugenia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you were here?&rdquo; exclaimed Acton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was in Felix&rsquo;s studio,&rdquo; said Madame Münster. &ldquo;He wanted to see his
      sketches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clifford looked at Robert Acton, but said nothing; he only fanned himself
      with his hat. &ldquo;You chose a bad moment,&rdquo; said Acton; &ldquo;you hadn&rsquo;t much
      light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t any!&rdquo; said Clifford, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your candle went out?&rdquo; Eugenia asked. &ldquo;You should have come back here and
      lighted it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clifford looked at her a moment. &ldquo;So I have&mdash;come back. But I have
      left the candle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenia turned away. &ldquo;You are very stupid, my poor boy. You had better go
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Clifford, &ldquo;good-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you a word to throw to a man when he has safely returned from a
      dangerous journey?&rdquo; Acton asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; said Clifford. &ldquo;I thought&mdash;I thought you
      were&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and he paused, looking at the Baroness again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You thought I was at Newport, eh? So I was&mdash;this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, clever child!&rdquo; said Madame Münster, over her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clifford stared at her&mdash;not at all like a clever child; and then,
      with one of his little facetious growls, took his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter with him?&rdquo; asked Acton, when he was gone. &ldquo;He seemed
      rather in a muddle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenia, who was near the window, glanced out, listening a moment. &ldquo;The
      matter&mdash;the matter&rdquo;&mdash;she answered. &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t say such
      things here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you mean that he had been drinking a little, you can say that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t drink any more. I have cured him. And in return&mdash;he&rsquo;s
      in love with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Acton&rsquo;s turn to stare. He instantly thought of his sister; but he
      said nothing about her. He began to laugh. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder at his passion!
      But I wonder at his forsaking your society for that of your brother&rsquo;s
      paint-brushes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenia was silent a little. &ldquo;He had not been in the studio. I invented
      that at the moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Invented it? For what purpose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has an idea of being romantic. He has adopted the habit of coming to
      see me at midnight&mdash;passing only through the orchard and through
      Felix&rsquo;s painting-room, which has a door opening that way. It seems to
      amuse him,&rdquo; added Eugenia, with a little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Acton felt more surprise than he confessed to, for this was a new view of
      Clifford, whose irregularities had hitherto been quite without the
      romantic element. He tried to laugh again, but he felt rather too serious,
      and after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation his seriousness explained itself. &ldquo;I hope
      you don&rsquo;t encourage him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He must not be inconstant to poor
      Lizzie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To your sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know they are decidedly intimate,&rdquo; said Acton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; cried Eugenia, smiling, &ldquo;has she&mdash;has she&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Acton interrupted, &ldquo;what she has. But I always supposed
      that Clifford had a desire to make himself agreeable to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, <i>par exemple!</i>&rdquo; the Baroness went on. &ldquo;The little monster! The next
      time he becomes sentimental I will him tell that he ought to be ashamed of
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Acton was silent a moment. &ldquo;You had better say nothing about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had told him as much already, on general grounds,&rdquo; said the Baroness.
      &ldquo;But in this country, you know, the relations of young people are so
      extraordinary that one is quite at sea. They are not engaged when you
      would quite say they ought to be. Take Charlotte Wentworth, for instance,
      and that young ecclesiastic. If I were her father I should insist upon his
      marrying her; but it appears to be thought there is no urgency. On the
      other hand, you suddenly learn that a boy of twenty and a little girl who
      is still with her governess&mdash;your sister has no governess? Well,
      then, who is never away from her mamma&mdash;a young couple, in short,
      between whom you have noticed nothing beyond an exchange of the childish
      pleasantries characteristic of their age, are on the point of setting up
      as man and wife.&rdquo; The Baroness spoke with a certain exaggerated volubility
      which was in contrast with the languid grace that had characterized her
      manner before Clifford made his appearance. It seemed to Acton that there
      was a spark of irritation in her eye&mdash;a note of irony (as when she
      spoke of Lizzie being never away from her mother) in her voice. If Madame
      Münster was irritated, Robert Acton was vaguely mystified; she began to
      move about the room again, and he looked at her without saying anything.
      Presently she took out her watch, and, glancing at it, declared that it
      was three o&rsquo;clock in the morning and that he must go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not been here an hour,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and they are still sitting up at
      the other house. You can see the lights. Your brother has not come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, at the other house,&rdquo; cried Eugenia, &ldquo;they are terrible people! I
      don&rsquo;t know what they may do over there. I am a quiet little humdrum woman;
      I have rigid rules and I keep them. One of them is not to have visitors in
      the small hours&mdash;especially clever men like you. So good-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Decidedly, the Baroness was incisive; and though Acton bade her good-night
      and departed, he was still a good deal mystified.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Clifford Wentworth came to see Lizzie, and Acton, who was at
      home and saw him pass through the garden, took note of the circumstance.
      He had a natural desire to make it tally with Madame Münster&rsquo;s account
      of Clifford&rsquo;s disaffection; but his ingenuity, finding itself unequal to
      the task, resolved at last to ask help of the young man&rsquo;s candor. He
      waited till he saw him going away, and then he went out and overtook him
      in the grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish very much you would answer me a question,&rdquo; Acton said. &ldquo;What were
      you doing, last night, at Madame Münster&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clifford began to laugh and to blush, by no means like a young man with a
      romantic secret. &ldquo;What did she tell you?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is exactly what I don&rsquo;t want to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I want to tell you the same,&rdquo; said Clifford; &ldquo;and unless I know it
      perhaps I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had stopped in a garden path; Acton looked hard at his rosy young
      kinsman. &ldquo;She said she couldn&rsquo;t fancy what had got into you; you appeared
      to have taken a violent dislike to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clifford stared, looking a little alarmed. &ldquo;Oh, come,&rdquo; he growled, &ldquo;you
      don&rsquo;t mean that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that when&mdash;for common civility&rsquo;s sake&mdash;you came
      occasionally to the house you left her alone and spent your time in
      Felix&rsquo;s studio, under pretext of looking at his sketches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come!&rdquo; growled Clifford, again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever know me to tell an untruth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, lots of them!&rdquo; said Clifford, seeing an opening, out of the
      discussion, for his sarcastic powers. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he presently added, &ldquo;I
      thought you were my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew someone was there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We heard you coming in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Acton meditated. &ldquo;You had been with the Baroness, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was in the parlor. We heard your step outside. I thought it was my
      father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And on that,&rdquo; asked Acton, &ldquo;you ran away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She told me to go&mdash;to go out by the studio.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Acton meditated more intensely; if there had been a chair at hand he would
      have sat down. &ldquo;Why should she wish you not to meet your father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Clifford, &ldquo;father doesn&rsquo;t like to see me there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Acton looked askance at his companion and forbore to make any comment upon
      this assertion. &ldquo;Has he said so,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;to the Baroness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I hope not,&rdquo; said Clifford. &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t said so&mdash;in so many
      words&mdash;to me. But I know it worries him; and I want to stop worrying
      him. The Baroness knows it, and she wants me to stop, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To stop coming to see her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that; but to stop worrying father. Eugenia knows
      everything,&rdquo; Clifford added, with an air of knowingness of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Acton, interrogatively, &ldquo;Eugenia knows everything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She knew it was not father coming in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why did you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clifford blushed and laughed afresh. &ldquo;Well, I was afraid it was. And
      besides, she told me to go, at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she think it was I?&rdquo; Acton asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Robert Acton reflected. &ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; he presently said;
      &ldquo;you came back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t get out of the studio,&rdquo; Clifford rejoined. &ldquo;The door was
      locked, and Felix has nailed some planks across the lower half of the
      confounded windows to make the light come in from above. So they were no
      use. I waited there a good while, and then, suddenly, I felt ashamed. I
      didn&rsquo;t want to be hiding away from my own father. I couldn&rsquo;t stand it
      any longer. I bolted out, and when I found it was you I was a little
      flurried. But Eugenia carried it off, didn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; Clifford added, in the
      tone of a young humorist whose perception had not been permanently clouded
      by the sense of his own discomfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beautifully!&rdquo; said Acton. &ldquo;Especially,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;when one remembers
      that you were very imprudent and that she must have been a good deal
      annoyed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried Clifford, with the indifference of a young man who feels that
      however he may have failed of felicity in behavior he is extremely just in
      his impressions, &ldquo;Eugenia doesn&rsquo;t care for anything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Acton hesitated a moment. &ldquo;Thank you for telling me this,&rdquo; he said at
      last. And then, laying his hand on Clifford&rsquo;s shoulder, he added, &ldquo;Tell me
      one thing more: are you by chance a little in love with the Baroness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir!&rdquo; said Clifford, almost shaking off his hand.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      The first sunday that followed Robert Acton&rsquo;s return from Newport
      witnessed a change in the brilliant weather that had long prevailed. The
      rain began to fall and the day was cold and dreary. Mr. Wentworth and his
      daughters put on overshoes and went to church, and Felix Young, without
      overshoes, went also, holding an umbrella over Gertrude. It is to be
      feared that, in the whole observance, this was the privilege he most
      highly valued. The Baroness remained at home; she was in neither a
      cheerful nor a devotional mood. She had, however, never been, during her
      residence in the United States, what is called a regular attendant at
      divine service; and on this particular Sunday morning of which I began
      with speaking she stood at the window of her little drawing-room, watching
      the long arm of a rose tree that was attached to her piazza, but a portion
      of which had disengaged itself, sway to and fro, shake and gesticulate,
      against the dusky drizzle of the sky. Every now and then, in a gust of
      wind, the rose tree scattered a shower of water-drops against the
      window-pane; it appeared to have a kind of human movement&mdash;a
      menacing, warning intention. The room was very cold; Madame Münster put on
      a shawl and walked about. Then she determined to have some fire; and
      summoning her ancient negress, the contrast of whose polished ebony and
      whose crimson turban had been at first a source of satisfaction to her,
      she made arrangements for the production of a crackling flame. This old
      woman&rsquo;s name was Azarina. The Baroness had begun by thinking that there
      would be a savory wildness in her talk, and, for amusement, she had
      encouraged her to chatter. But Azarina was dry and prim; her conversation
      was anything but African; she reminded Eugenia of the tiresome old ladies
      she met in society. She knew, however, how to make a fire; so that after
      she had laid the logs, Eugenia, who was terribly bored, found a quarter of
      an hour&rsquo;s entertainment in sitting and watching them blaze and sputter.
      She had thought it very likely Robert Acton would come and see her; she
      had not met him since that infelicitous evening. But the morning waned
      without his coming; several times she thought she heard his step on the
      piazza; but it was only a window-shutter shaking in a rain-gust. The
      Baroness, since the beginning of that episode in her career of which a
      slight sketch has been attempted in these pages, had had many moments of
      irritation. But today her irritation had a peculiar keenness; it appeared
      to feed upon itself. It urged her to do something; but it suggested no
      particularly profitable line of action. If she could have done something
      at the moment, on the spot, she would have stepped upon a European steamer
      and turned her back, with a kind of rapture, upon that profoundly
      mortifying failure, her visit to her American relations. It is not exactly
      apparent why she should have termed this enterprise a failure, inasmuch as
      she had been treated with the highest distinction for which allowance had
      been made in American institutions. Her irritation came, at bottom, from
      the sense, which, always present, had suddenly grown acute, that the
      social soil on this big, vague continent was somehow not adapted for
      growing those plants whose fragrance she especially inclined to inhale and
      by which she liked to see herself surrounded&mdash;a species of vegetation
      for which she carried a collection of seedlings, as we may say, in her
      pocket. She found her chief happiness in the sense of exerting a certain
      power and making a certain impression; and now she felt the annoyance of a
      rather wearied swimmer who, on nearing shore, to land, finds a smooth
      straight wall of rock when he had counted upon a clean firm beach. Her
      power, in the American air, seemed to have lost its prehensile attributes;
      the smooth wall of rock was insurmountable. <i>&ldquo;Surely je n&rsquo;en suis pas là,&rdquo;</i>
      she said to herself, &ldquo;that I let it make me uncomfortable that a Mr.
      Robert Acton shouldn&rsquo;t honor me with a visit!&rdquo; Yet she was vexed that he
      had not come; and she was vexed at her vexation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her brother, at least, came in, stamping in the hall and shaking the wet
      from his coat. In a moment he entered the room, with a glow in his cheek
      and half-a-dozen rain-drops glistening on his moustache. &ldquo;Ah, you have a
      fire,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Les beaux jours sont passés,&rdquo;</i> replied the Baroness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, never! They have only begun,&rdquo; Felix declared, planting himself
      before the hearth. He turned his back to the fire, placed his hands behind
      him, extended his legs and looked away through the window with an
      expression of face which seemed to denote the perception of rose-color
      even in the tints of a wet Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      His sister, from her chair, looked up at him, watching him; and what she
      saw in his face was not grateful to her present mood. She was puzzled by
      many things, but her brother&rsquo;s disposition was a frequent source of wonder
      to her. I say frequent and not constant, for there were long periods
      during which she gave her attention to other problems. Sometimes she had
      said to herself that his happy temper, his eternal gaiety, was an
      affectation, a <i>pose</i>; but she was vaguely conscious that during the present
      summer he had been a highly successful comedian. They had never yet had an
      explanation; she had not known the need of one. Felix was presumably
      following the bent of his disinterested genius, and she felt that she had
      no advice to give him that he would understand. With this, there was
      always a certain element of comfort about Felix&mdash;the assurance that
      he would not interfere. He was very delicate, this pure-minded Felix; in
      effect, he was her brother, and Madame Münster felt that there was a great
      propriety, every way, in that. It is true that Felix was delicate; he was
      not fond of explanations with his sister; this was one of the very few
      things in the world about which he was uncomfortable. But now he was not
      thinking of anything uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear brother,&rdquo; said Eugenia at last, &ldquo;do stop making <i>les yeux doux</i> at the
      rain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With pleasure. I will make them at you!&rdquo; answered Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much longer,&rdquo; asked Eugenia, in a moment, &ldquo;do you propose to remain
      in this lovely spot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix stared. &ldquo;Do you want to go away&mdash;already?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Already&rsquo; is delicious. I am not so happy as you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix dropped into a chair, looking at the fire. &ldquo;The fact is I <i>am</i> happy,&rdquo;
       he said in his light, clear tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you propose to spend your life in making love to Gertrude
      Wentworth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said Felix, smiling sidewise at his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness returned his glance, much more gravely; and then, &ldquo;Do you
      like her?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Felix demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness was silent a moment. &ldquo;I will answer you in the words of the
      gentleman who was asked if he liked music: <i>&lsquo;Je ne la crains pas!&rsquo;&rsquo;</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She admires you immensely,&rdquo; said Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for that. Other women should not admire one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They should dislike you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Madame Münster hesitated. &ldquo;They should hate me! It&rsquo;s a measure of
      the time I have been losing here that they don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No time is lost in which one has been happy!&rdquo; said Felix, with a bright
      sententiousness which may well have been a little irritating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in which,&rdquo; rejoined his sister, with a harsher laugh, &ldquo;one has
      secured the affections of a young lady with a fortune!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix explained, very candidly and seriously. &ldquo;I have secured Gertrude&rsquo;s
      affection, but I am by no means sure that I have secured her fortune. That
      may come&mdash;or it may not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well, it <i>may!</i> That&rsquo;s the great point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It depends upon her father. He doesn&rsquo;t smile upon our union. You know he
      wants her to marry Mr. Brand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing about it!&rdquo; cried the Baroness. &ldquo;Please to put on a log.&rdquo;
       Felix complied with her request and sat watching the quickening of the
      flame. Presently his sister added, &ldquo;And you propose to elope with
      mademoiselle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means. I don&rsquo;t wish to do anything that&rsquo;s disagreeable to Mr.
      Wentworth. He has been far too kind to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must choose between pleasing yourself and pleasing him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to please everyone!&rdquo; exclaimed Felix, joyously. &ldquo;I have a good
      conscience. I made up my mind at the outset that it was not my place to
      make love to Gertrude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, to simplify matters, she made love to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix looked at his sister with sudden gravity. &ldquo;You say you are not
      afraid of her,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But perhaps you ought to be&mdash;a little.
      She&rsquo;s a very clever person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I begin to see it!&rdquo; cried the Baroness. Her brother, making no rejoinder,
      leaned back in his chair, and there was a long silence. At last, with an
      altered accent, Madame Münster put another question. &ldquo;You expect, at any
      rate, to marry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be greatly disappointed if we don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A disappointment or two will do you good!&rdquo; the Baroness declared. &ldquo;And,
      afterwards, do you mean to turn American?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me I am a very good American already. But we shall go to
      Europe. Gertrude wants extremely to see the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, like me, when I came here!&rdquo; said the Baroness, with a little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not like you,&rdquo; Felix rejoined, looking at his sister with a certain
      gentle seriousness. While he looked at her she rose from her chair, and he
      also got up. &ldquo;Gertrude is not at all like you,&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;but in her
      own way she is almost as clever.&rdquo; He paused a moment; his soul was full of
      an agreeable feeling and of a lively disposition to express it. His
      sister, to his spiritual vision, was always like the lunar disk when only
      a part of it is lighted. The shadow on this bright surface seemed to him
      to expand and to contract; but whatever its proportions, he always
      appreciated the moonlight. He looked at the Baroness, and then he kissed
      her. &ldquo;I am very much in love with Gertrude,&rdquo; he said. Eugenia turned away
      and walked about the room, and Felix continued. &ldquo;She is very interesting,
      and very different from what she seems. She has never had a chance. She is
      very brilliant. We will go to Europe and amuse ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness had gone to the window, where she stood looking out. The day
      was drearier than ever; the rain was doggedly falling. &ldquo;Yes, to amuse
      yourselves,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;you had decidedly better go to Europe!&rdquo;
       Then she turned round, looking at her brother. A chair stood near her; she
      leaned her hands upon the back of it. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it is very good of
      me,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;to come all this way with you simply to see you properly
      married&mdash;if properly it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it will be properly!&rdquo; cried Felix, with light eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness gave a little laugh. &ldquo;You are thinking only of yourself, and
      you don&rsquo;t answer my question. While you are amusing yourself&mdash;with
      the brilliant Gertrude&mdash;what shall I be doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Vous serez de la partie!&rdquo;</i> cried Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you: I should spoil it.&rdquo; The Baroness dropped her eyes for some
      moments. &ldquo;Do you propose, however, to leave me here?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix smiled at her. &ldquo;My dearest sister, where you are concerned I never
      propose. I execute your commands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; said Eugenia, slowly, &ldquo;that you are the most heartless person
      living. Don&rsquo;t you see that I am in trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw that you were not cheerful, and I gave you some good news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let me give you some news,&rdquo; said the Baroness. &ldquo;You probably will
      not have discovered it for yourself. Robert Acton wants to marry me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I had not discovered that. But I quite understand it. Why does it
      make you unhappy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I can&rsquo;t decide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accept him, accept him!&rdquo; cried Felix, joyously. &ldquo;He is the best fellow in
      the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is immensely in love with me,&rdquo; said the Baroness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he has a large fortune. Permit me in turn to remind you of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am perfectly aware of it,&rdquo; said Eugenia. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great item in
      his favor. I am terribly candid.&rdquo; And she left her place and came nearer
      her brother, looking at him hard. He was turning over several things; she
      was wondering in what manner he really understood her.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were several ways of understanding her: there was what she said, and
      there was what she meant, and there was something, between the two, that
      was neither. It is probable that, in the last analysis, what she meant was
      that Felix should spare her the necessity of stating the case more exactly
      and should hold himself commissioned to assist her by all honorable means
      to marry the best fellow in the world. But in all this it was never
      discovered what Felix understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once you have your liberty, what are your objections?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t particularly like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, try a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am trying now,&rdquo; said Eugenia. &ldquo;I should succeed better if he didn&rsquo;t
      live here. I could never live here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make him go to Europe,&rdquo; Felix suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, there you speak of happiness based upon violent effort,&rdquo; the Baroness
      rejoined. &ldquo;That is not what I am looking for. He would never live in
      Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would live anywhere, with you!&rdquo; said Felix, gallantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His sister looked at him still, with a ray of penetration in her charming
      eyes; then she turned away again. &ldquo;You see, at all events,&rdquo; she presently
      went on, &ldquo;that if it had been said of me that I had come over here to seek
      my fortune it would have to be added that I have found it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave it lying!&rdquo; urged Felix, with smiling solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am much obliged to you for your interest,&rdquo; his sister declared, after a
      moment. &ldquo;But promise me one thing: <i>pas de zèle!</i> If Mr. Acton should ask
      you to plead his cause, excuse yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall certainly have the excuse,&rdquo; said Felix, &ldquo;that I have a cause of
      my own to plead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he should talk of me&mdash;favorably,&rdquo; Eugenia continued, &ldquo;warn him
      against dangerous illusions. I detest importunities; I want to decide at
      my leisure, with my eyes open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be discreet,&rdquo; said Felix, &ldquo;except to you. To you I will say,
      Accept him outright.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had advanced to the open doorway, and she stood looking at him. &ldquo;I
      will go and dress and think of it,&rdquo; she said; and he heard her moving
      slowly to her apartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in the afternoon the rain stopped, and just afterwards there was a
      great flaming, flickering, trickling sunset. Felix sat in his
      painting-room and did some work; but at last, as the light, which had not
      been brilliant, began to fade, he laid down his brushes and came out to
      the little piazza of the cottage. Here he walked up and down for some
      time, looking at the splendid blaze of the western sky and saying, as he
      had often said before, that this was certainly the country of sunsets.
      There was something in these glorious deeps of fire that quickened his
      imagination; he always found images and promises in the western sky. He
      thought of a good many things&mdash;of roaming about the world with
      Gertrude Wentworth; he seemed to see their possible adventures, in a
      glowing frieze, between the cloud-bars; then of what Eugenia had just been
      telling him. He wished very much that Madame Münster would make a
      comfortable and honorable marriage. Presently, as the sunset expanded and
      deepened, the fancy took him of making a note of so magnificent a piece of
      coloring. He returned to his studio and fetched out a small panel, with
      his palette and brushes, and, placing the panel against a window-sill, he
      began to daub with great gusto. While he was so occupied he saw Mr. Brand,
      in the distance, slowly come down from Mr. Wentworth&rsquo;s house, nursing a
      large folded umbrella. He walked with a joyless, meditative tread, and his
      eyes were bent upon the ground. Felix poised his brush for a moment,
      watching him; then, by a sudden impulse, as he drew nearer, advanced to
      the garden-gate and signaled to him&mdash;the palette and bunch of brushes
      contributing to this effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brand stopped and started; then he appeared to decide to accept
      Felix&rsquo;s invitation. He came out of Mr. Wentworth&rsquo;s gate and passed along
      the road; after which he entered the little garden of the cottage. Felix
      had gone back to his sunset; but he made his visitor welcome while he
      rapidly brushed it in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted so much to speak to you that I thought I would call you,&rdquo; he
      said, in the friendliest tone. &ldquo;All the more that you have been to see me
      so little. You have come to see my sister; I know that. But you haven&rsquo;t
      come to see me&mdash;the celebrated artist. Artists are very sensitive,
      you know; they notice those things.&rdquo; And Felix turned round, smiling, with
      a brush in his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brand stood there with a certain blank, candid majesty, pulling
      together the large flaps of his umbrella. &ldquo;Why should I come to see you?&rdquo;
       he asked. &ldquo;I know nothing of Art.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would sound very conceited, I suppose,&rdquo; said Felix, &ldquo;if I were to say
      that it would be a good little chance for you to learn something. You
      would ask me why you should learn; and I should have no answer to that. I
      suppose a minister has no need for Art, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has need for good temper, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Brand, with decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix jumped up, with his palette on his thumb and a movement of the
      liveliest deprecation. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because I keep you standing there while I
      splash my red paint! I beg a thousand pardons! You see what bad manners
      Art gives a man; and how right you are to let it alone. I didn&rsquo;t mean you
      should stand, either. The piazza, as you see, is ornamented with rustic
      chairs; though indeed I ought to warn you that they have nails in the
      wrong places. I was just making a note of that sunset. I never saw such a
      blaze of different reds. It looks as if the Celestial City were in flames,
      eh? If that were really the case I suppose it would be the business of you
      theologians to put out the fire. Fancy me&mdash;an ungodly artist&mdash;quietly
      sitting down to paint it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brand had always credited Felix Young with a certain impudence, but it
      appeared to him that on this occasion his impudence was so great as to
      make a special explanation&mdash;or even an apology&mdash;necessary. And
      the impression, it must be added, was sufficiently natural. Felix had at
      all times a brilliant assurance of manner which was simply the vehicle of
      his good spirits and his good will; but at present he had a special
      design, and as he would have admitted that the design was audacious, so he
      was conscious of having summoned all the arts of conversation to his aid.
      But he was so far from desiring to offend his visitor that he was rapidly
      asking himself what personal compliment he could pay the young clergyman
      that would gratify him most. If he could think of it, he was prepared to
      pay it down. &ldquo;Have you been preaching one of your beautiful sermons
      today?&rdquo; he suddenly asked, laying down his palette. This was not what
      Felix had been trying to think of, but it was a tolerable stop-gap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brand frowned&mdash;as much as a man can frown who has very fair, soft
      eyebrows, and, beneath them, very gentle, tranquil eyes. &ldquo;No, I have not
      preached any sermon today. Did you bring me over here for the purpose of
      making that inquiry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix saw that he was irritated, and he regretted it immensely; but he had
      no fear of not being, in the end, agreeable to Mr. Brand. He looked at
      him, smiling and laying his hand on his arm. &ldquo;No, no, not for that&mdash;not
      for that. I wanted to ask you something; I wanted to tell you something. I
      am sure it will interest you very much. Only&mdash;as it is something
      rather private&mdash;we had better come into my little studio. I have a
      western window; we can still see the sunset. <i>Andiamo!</i>&rdquo; And he gave a
      little pat to his companion&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      He led the way in; Mr. Brand stiffly and softly followed. The twilight had
      thickened in the little studio; but the wall opposite the western window
      was covered with a deep pink flush. There were a great many sketches and
      half-finished canvasses suspended in this rosy glow, and the corners of
      the room were vague and dusky. Felix begged Mr. Brand to sit down; then
      glancing round him, &ldquo;By Jove, how pretty it looks!&rdquo; he cried. But Mr.
      Brand would not sit down; he went and leaned against the window; he
      wondered what Felix wanted of him. In the shadow, on the darker parts of
      the wall, he saw the gleam of three or four pictures that looked fantastic
      and surprising. They seemed to represent naked figures. Felix stood there,
      with his head a little bent and his eyes fixed upon his visitor, smiling
      intensely, pulling his moustache. Mr. Brand felt vaguely uneasy. &ldquo;It is
      very delicate&mdash;what I want to say,&rdquo; Felix began. &ldquo;But I have been
      thinking of it for some time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please to say it as quickly as possible,&rdquo; said Mr. Brand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because you are a clergyman, you know,&rdquo; Felix went on. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      think I should venture to say it to a common man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brand was silent a moment. &ldquo;If it is a question of yielding to a
      weakness, of resenting an injury, I am afraid I am a very common man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dearest friend,&rdquo; cried Felix, &ldquo;this is not an injury; it&rsquo;s a benefit&mdash;a
      great service! You will like it extremely. Only it&rsquo;s so delicate!&rdquo; And,
      in the dim light, he continued to smile intensely. &ldquo;You know I take a
      great interest in my cousins&mdash;in Charlotte and Gertrude Wentworth.
      That&rsquo;s very evident from my having traveled some five thousand miles to
      see them.&rdquo; Mr. Brand said nothing and Felix proceeded. &ldquo;Coming into their
      society as a perfect stranger I received of course a great many new
      impressions, and my impressions had a great freshness, a great keenness.
      Do you know what I mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sure that I do; but I should like you to continue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think my impressions have always a good deal of freshness,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Brand&rsquo;s entertainer; &ldquo;but on this occasion it was perhaps particularly
      natural that&mdash;coming in, as I say, from outside&mdash;I should be
      struck with things that passed unnoticed among yourselves. And then I had
      my sister to help me; and she is simply the most observant woman in the
      world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not surprised,&rdquo; said Mr. Brand, &ldquo;that in our little circle two
      intelligent persons should have found food for observation. I am sure
      that, of late, I have found it myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but I shall surprise you yet!&rdquo; cried Felix, laughing. &ldquo;Both my sister
      and I took a great fancy to my cousin Charlotte.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your cousin Charlotte?&rdquo; repeated Mr. Brand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We fell in love with her from the first!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fell in love with Charlotte?&rdquo; Mr. Brand murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Dame!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed Felix, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s a very charming person; and Eugenia was
      especially smitten.&rdquo; Mr. Brand stood staring, and he pursued, &ldquo;Affection,
      you know, opens one&rsquo;s eyes, and we noticed something. Charlotte is not
      happy! Charlotte is in love.&rdquo; And Felix, drawing nearer, laid his hand
      again upon his companion&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something akin to an acknowledgment of fascination in the way
      Mr. Brand looked at him; but the young clergyman retained as yet quite
      enough self-possession to be able to say, with a good deal of solemnity,
      &ldquo;She is not in love with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix gave a light laugh, and rejoined with the alacrity of a maritime
      adventurer who feels a puff of wind in his sail. &ldquo;Ah, no; if she were in
      love with me I should know it! I am not so blind as you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir, you are stone blind. Poor Charlotte is dead in love with
      <i>you!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brand said nothing for a moment; he breathed a little heavily. &ldquo;Is
      that what you wanted to say to me?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have wanted to say it these three weeks. Because of late she has been
      worse. I told you,&rdquo; added Felix, &ldquo;it was very delicate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir&rdquo;&mdash;Mr. Brand began; &ldquo;well, sir&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was sure you didn&rsquo;t know it,&rdquo; Felix continued. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you see&mdash;as
      soon as I mention it&mdash;how everything is explained?&rdquo; Mr. Brand
      answered nothing; he looked for a chair and softly sat down. Felix could
      see that he was blushing; he had looked straight at his host hitherto, but
      now he looked away. The foremost effect of what he had heard had been a
      sort of irritation of his modesty. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Felix, &ldquo;I suggest
      nothing; it would be very presumptuous in me to advise you. But I think
      there is no doubt about the fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brand looked hard at the floor for some moments; he was oppressed with
      a mixture of sensations. Felix, standing there, was very sure that one of
      them was profound surprise. The innocent young man had been completely
      unsuspicious of poor Charlotte&rsquo;s hidden flame. This gave Felix great hope;
      he was sure that Mr. Brand would be flattered. Felix thought him very
      transparent, and indeed he was so; he could neither simulate nor
      dissimulate. &ldquo;I scarcely know what to make of this,&rdquo; he said at last,
      without looking up; and Felix was struck with the fact that he offered no
      protest or contradiction. Evidently Felix had kindled a train of memories&mdash;a
      retrospective illumination. It was making, to Mr. Brand&rsquo;s astonished eyes,
      a very pretty blaze; his second emotion had been a gratification of
      vanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank me for telling you,&rdquo; Felix rejoined. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sure of that,&rdquo; said Mr. Brand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, don&rsquo;t let her languish!&rdquo; Felix murmured, lightly and softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>do</i> advise me, then?&rdquo; And Mr. Brand looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I congratulate you!&rdquo; said Felix, smiling. He had thought at first his
      visitor was simply appealing; but he saw he was a little ironical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is in your interest; you have interfered with me,&rdquo; the young clergyman
      went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix still stood and smiled. The little room had grown darker, and the
      crimson glow had faded; but Mr. Brand could see the brilliant expression
      of his face. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t pretend not to know what you mean,&rdquo; said Felix at
      last. &ldquo;But I have not really interfered with you. Of what you had to lose&mdash;with
      another person&mdash;you have lost nothing. And think what you have
      gained!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me I am the proper judge, on each side,&rdquo; Mr. Brand declared.
      He got up, holding the brim of his hat against his mouth and staring at
      Felix through the dusk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have lost an illusion!&rdquo; said Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you call an illusion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The belief that you really know&mdash;that you have ever really known&mdash;Gertrude
      Wentworth. Depend upon that,&rdquo; pursued Felix. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know her yet; but I
      have no illusions; I don&rsquo;t pretend to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brand kept gazing, over his hat. &ldquo;She has always been a lucid, limpid
      nature,&rdquo; he said, solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has always been a dormant nature. She was waiting for a touchstone.
      But now she is beginning to awaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t praise her to me!&rdquo; said Mr. Brand, with a little quaver in his
      voice. &ldquo;If you have the advantage of me that is not generous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir, I am melting with generosity!&rdquo; exclaimed Felix. &ldquo;And I am
      not praising my cousin. I am simply attempting a scientific definition of
      her. She doesn&rsquo;t care for abstractions. Now I think the contrary is what
      you have always fancied&mdash;is the basis on which you have been
      building. She is extremely preoccupied with the concrete. I care for the
      concrete, too. But Gertrude is stronger than I; she whirls me along!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brand looked for a moment into the crown of his hat. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a most
      interesting nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; said Felix. &ldquo;But it pulls&mdash;it pulls&mdash;like a runaway
      horse. Now I like the feeling of a runaway horse; and if I am thrown out
      of the vehicle it is no great matter. But if <i>you</i> should be thrown, Mr.
      Brand&rdquo;&mdash;and Felix paused a moment&mdash;&ldquo;another person also would
      suffer from the accident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What other person?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charlotte Wentworth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brand looked at Felix for a moment sidewise, mistrustfully; then his
      eyes slowly wandered over the ceiling. Felix was sure he was secretly
      struck with the romance of the situation. &ldquo;I think this is none of our
      business,&rdquo; the young minister murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None of mine, perhaps; but surely yours!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brand lingered still, looking at the ceiling; there was evidently
      something he wanted to say. &ldquo;What do you mean by Miss Gertrude being
      strong?&rdquo; he asked abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Felix meditatively, &ldquo;I mean that she has had a great deal of
      self-possession. She was waiting&mdash;for years; even when she seemed,
      perhaps, to be living in the present. She knew how to wait; she had a
      purpose. That&rsquo;s what I mean by her being strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what do you mean by her purpose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;the purpose to see the world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brand eyed his strange informant askance again; but he said nothing.
      At last he turned away, as if to take leave. He seemed bewildered,
      however; for instead of going to the door he moved toward the opposite
      corner of the room. Felix stood and watched him for a moment&mdash;almost
      groping about in the dusk; then he led him to the door, with a tender,
      almost fraternal movement. &ldquo;Is that all you have to say?&rdquo; asked Mr. Brand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s all&mdash;but it will bear a good deal of thinking of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix went with him to the garden-gate, and watched him slowly walk away
      into the thickening twilight with a relaxed rigidity that tried to rectify
      itself. &ldquo;He is offended, excited, bewildered, perplexed&mdash;and
      enchanted!&rdquo; Felix said to himself. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a capital mixture.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Since that visit paid by the Baroness Münster to Mrs. Acton, of which some
      account was given at an earlier stage of this narrative, the intercourse
      between these two ladies had been neither frequent nor intimate. It was
      not that Mrs. Acton had failed to appreciate Madame Münster&rsquo;s charms;
      on the contrary, her perception of the graces of manner and conversation
      of her brilliant visitor had been only too acute. Mrs. Acton was, as they
      said in Boston, very &ldquo;intense,&rdquo; and her impressions were apt to be too
      many for her. The state of her health required the restriction of emotion;
      and this is why, receiving, as she sat in her eternal arm-chair, very few
      visitors, even of the soberest local type, she had been obliged to limit
      the number of her interviews with a lady whose costume and manner recalled
      to her imagination&mdash;Mrs. Acton&rsquo;s imagination was a marvel&mdash;all
      that she had ever read of the most stirring historical periods. But she
      had sent the Baroness a great many quaintly-worded messages and a great
      many nosegays from her garden and baskets of beautiful fruit. Felix had
      eaten the fruit, and the Baroness had arranged the flowers and returned
      the baskets and the messages. On the day that followed that rainy Sunday
      of which mention has been made, Eugenia determined to go and pay the
      beneficent invalid a <i>&ldquo;visite d&rsquo;adieux&rdquo;</i>; so it was that, to herself, she
      qualified her enterprise. It may be noted that neither on the Sunday
      evening nor on the Monday morning had she received that expected visit
      from Robert Acton. To his own consciousness, evidently he was &ldquo;keeping
      away;&rdquo; and as the Baroness, on her side, was keeping away from her
      uncle&rsquo;s, whither, for several days, Felix had been the unembarrassed
      bearer of apologies and regrets for absence, chance had not taken the
      cards from the hands of design. Mr. Wentworth and his daughters had
      respected Eugenia&rsquo;s seclusion; certain intervals of mysterious retirement
      appeared to them, vaguely, a natural part of the graceful, rhythmic
      movement of so remarkable a life. Gertrude especially held these periods
      in honor; she wondered what Madame Münster did at such times, but she
      would not have permitted herself to inquire too curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The long rain had freshened the air, and twelve hours&rsquo; brilliant sunshine
      had dried the roads; so that the Baroness, in the late afternoon,
      proposing to walk to Mrs. Acton&rsquo;s, exposed herself to no great discomfort.
      As with her charming undulating step she moved along the clean, grassy
      margin of the road, beneath the thickly-hanging boughs of the orchards,
      through the quiet of the hour and place and the rich maturity of the
      summer, she was even conscious of a sort of luxurious melancholy. The
      Baroness had the amiable weakness of attaching herself to places&mdash;even
      when she had begun with a little aversion; and now, with the prospect of
      departure, she felt tenderly toward this well-wooded corner of the Western
      world, where the sunsets were so beautiful and one&rsquo;s ambitions were so
      pure. Mrs. Acton was able to receive her; but on entering this lady&rsquo;s
      large, freshly-scented room the Baroness saw that she was looking very
      ill. She was wonderfully white and transparent, and, in her flowered
      arm-chair, she made no attempt to move. But she flushed a little&mdash;like
      a young girl, the Baroness thought&mdash;and she rested her clear, smiling
      eyes upon those of her visitor. Her voice was low and monotonous, like a
      voice that had never expressed any human passions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to bid you good-bye,&rdquo; said Eugenia. &ldquo;I shall soon be going
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When are you going away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very soon&mdash;any day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; said Mrs. Acton. &ldquo;I hoped you would stay&mdash;always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always?&rdquo; Eugenia demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I mean a long time,&rdquo; said Mrs. Acton, in her sweet, feeble tone.
      &ldquo;They tell me you are so comfortable&mdash;that you have got such a
      beautiful little house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenia stared&mdash;that is, she smiled; she thought of her poor little
      chalet and she wondered whether her hostess were jesting. &ldquo;Yes, my house
      is exquisite,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;though not to be compared to yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my son is so fond of going to see you,&rdquo; Mrs. Acton added. &ldquo;I am
      afraid my son will miss you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, dear madam,&rdquo; said Eugenia, with a little laugh, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stay in
      America for your son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like America?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness looked at the front of her dress. &ldquo;If I liked it&mdash;that
      would not be staying for your son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Acton gazed at her with her grave, tender eyes, as if she had not
      quite understood. The Baroness at last found something irritating in the
      sweet, soft stare of her hostess; and if one were not bound to be merciful
      to great invalids she would almost have taken the liberty of pronouncing
      her, mentally, a fool. &ldquo;I am afraid, then, I shall never see you again,&rdquo;
       said Mrs. Acton. &ldquo;You know I am dying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, dear madam,&rdquo; murmured Eugenia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to leave my children cheerful and happy. My daughter will probably
      marry her cousin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two such interesting young people,&rdquo; said the Baroness, vaguely. She was
      not thinking of Clifford Wentworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel so tranquil about my end,&rdquo; Mrs. Acton went on. &ldquo;It is coming so
      easily, so surely.&rdquo; And she paused, with her mild gaze always on
      Eugenia&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness hated to be reminded of death; but even in its imminence, so
      far as Mrs. Acton was concerned, she preserved her good manners. &ldquo;Ah,
      madam, you are too charming an invalid,&rdquo; she rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the delicacy of this rejoinder was apparently lost upon her hostess,
      who went on in her low, reasonable voice. &ldquo;I want to leave my children
      bright and comfortable. You seem to me all so happy here&mdash;just as you
      are. So I wish you could stay. It would be so pleasant for Robert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenia wondered what she meant by its being pleasant for Robert; but she
      felt that she would never know what such a woman as that meant. She got
      up; she was afraid Mrs. Acton would tell her again that she was dying.
      &ldquo;Good-bye, dear madam,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I must remember that your strength is
      precious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Acton took her hand and held it a moment. &ldquo;Well, you <i>have</i> been happy
      here, haven&rsquo;t you? And you like us all, don&rsquo;t you? I wish you would
      stay,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;in your beautiful little house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had told Eugenia that her waiting-woman would be in the hall, to show
      her downstairs; but the large landing outside her door was empty, and
      Eugenia stood there looking about. She felt irritated; the dying lady had
      not <i>&ldquo;la main heureuse.&rdquo;</i> She passed slowly downstairs, still looking
      about. The broad staircase made a great bend, and in the angle was a high
      window, looking westward, with a deep bench, covered with a row of
      flowering plants in curious old pots of blue china-ware. The yellow
      afternoon light came in through the flowers and flickered a little on the
      white wainscots. Eugenia paused a moment; the house was perfectly still,
      save for the ticking, somewhere, of a great clock. The lower hall
      stretched away at the foot of the stairs, half covered over with a large
      Oriental rug. Eugenia lingered a little, noticing a great many things.
      <i>&ldquo;Comme c&rsquo;est bien!&rdquo;</i> she said to herself; such a large, solid,
      irreproachable basis of existence the place seemed to her to indicate. And
      then she reflected that Mrs. Acton was soon to withdraw from it. The
      reflection accompanied her the rest of the way downstairs, where she
      paused again, making more observations. The hall was extremely broad, and
      on either side of the front door was a wide, deeply-set window, which
      threw the shadows of everything back into the house. There were
      high-backed chairs along the wall and big Eastern vases upon tables, and,
      on either side, a large cabinet with a glass front and little curiosities
      within, dimly gleaming. The doors were open&mdash;into the darkened
      parlor, the library, the dining-room. All these rooms seemed empty.
      Eugenia passed along, and stopped a moment on the threshold of each.
      <i>&ldquo;Comme c&rsquo;est bien!&rdquo;</i> she murmured again; she had thought of just such a
      house as this when she decided to come to America. She opened the front
      door for herself&mdash;her light tread had summoned none of the servants&mdash;and
      on the threshold she gave a last look. Outside, she was still in the humor
      for curious contemplation; so instead of going directly down the little
      drive, to the gate, she wandered away towards the garden, which lay to the
      right of the house. She had not gone many yards over the grass before she
      paused quickly; she perceived a gentleman stretched upon the level
      verdure, beneath a tree. He had not heard her coming, and he lay
      motionless, flat on his back, with his hands clasped under his head,
      staring up at the sky; so that the Baroness was able to reflect, at her
      leisure, upon the question of his identity. It was that of a person who
      had lately been much in her thoughts; but her first impulse, nevertheless,
      was to turn away; the last thing she desired was to have the air of coming
      in quest of Robert Acton. The gentleman on the grass, however, gave her no
      time to decide; he could not long remain unconscious of so agreeable a
      presence. He rolled back his eyes, stared, gave an exclamation, and then
      jumped up. He stood an instant, looking at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse my ridiculous position,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just now no sense of the ridiculous. But, in case you have, don&rsquo;t
      imagine I came to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care,&rdquo; rejoined Acton, &ldquo;how you put it into my head! I was thinking
      of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The occupation of extreme leisure!&rdquo; said the Baroness. &ldquo;To think of a
      woman when you are in that position is no compliment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say I was thinking well!&rdquo; Acton affirmed, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him, and then she turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though I didn&rsquo;t come to see you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;remember at least that I am
      within your gates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am delighted&mdash;I am honored! Won&rsquo;t you come into the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just come out of it. I have been calling upon your mother. I have
      been bidding her farewell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell?&rdquo; Acton demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going away,&rdquo; said the Baroness. And she turned away again, as if to
      illustrate her meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When are you going?&rdquo; asked Acton, standing a moment in his place. But the
      Baroness made no answer, and he followed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came this way to look at your garden,&rdquo; she said, walking back to the
      gate, over the grass. &ldquo;But I must go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me at least go with you.&rdquo; He went with her, and they said nothing
      till they reached the gate. It was open, and they looked down the road
      which was darkened over with long bosky shadows. &ldquo;Must you go straight
      home?&rdquo; Acton asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she made no answer. She said, after a moment, &ldquo;Why have you not been
      to see me?&rdquo; He said nothing, and then she went on, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you answer
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am trying to invent an answer,&rdquo; Acton confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you none ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None that I can tell you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But let me walk with you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may do as you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She moved slowly along the road, and Acton went with her. Presently he
      said, &ldquo;If I had done as I liked I would have come to see you several
      times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that invented?&rdquo; asked Eugenia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that is natural. I stayed away because&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, here comes the reason, then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I wanted to think about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you wanted to lie down!&rdquo; said the Baroness. &ldquo;I have seen you lie
      down&mdash;almost&mdash;in my drawing-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Acton stopped in the road, with a movement which seemed to beg her to
      linger a little. She paused, and he looked at her awhile; he thought her
      very charming. &ldquo;You are jesting,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but if you are really going
      away it is very serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I stay,&rdquo; and she gave a little laugh, &ldquo;it is more serious still!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When shall you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I stay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because we all admire you so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not a reason. I am admired also in Europe.&rdquo; And she began to walk
      homeward again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What could I say to keep you?&rdquo; asked Acton. He wanted to keep her, and it
      was a fact that he had been thinking of her for a week. He was in love
      with her now; he was conscious of that, or he thought he was; and the only
      question with him was whether he could trust her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you can say to keep me?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;As I want very much to go it
      is not in my interest to tell you. Besides, I can&rsquo;t imagine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went on with her in silence; he was much more affected by what she had
      told him than appeared. Ever since that evening of his return from Newport
      her image had had a terrible power to trouble him. What Clifford Wentworth
      had told him&mdash;that had affected him, too, in an adverse sense; but it
      had not liberated him from the discomfort of a charm of which his
      intelligence was impatient. &ldquo;She is not honest, she is not honest,&rdquo; he
      kept murmuring to himself. That is what he had been saying to the summer
      sky, ten minutes before. Unfortunately, he was unable to say it finally,
      definitively; and now that he was near her it seemed to matter wonderfully
      little. &ldquo;She is a woman who will lie,&rdquo; he had said to himself. Now, as he
      went along, he reminded himself of this observation; but it failed to
      frighten him as it had done before. He almost wished he could make her lie
      and then convict her of it, so that he might see how he should like that.
      He kept thinking of this as he walked by her side, while she moved forward
      with her light, graceful dignity. He had sat with her before; he had
      driven with her; but he had never walked with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, how <i>comme il faut</i> she is!&rdquo; he said, as he observed her sidewise.
      When they reached the cottage in the orchard she passed into the gate
      without asking him to follow; but she turned round, as he stood there, to
      bid him good-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked you a question the other night which you never answered,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;Have you sent off that document&mdash;liberating yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated for a single moment&mdash;very naturally. Then, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she
      said, simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned away; he wondered whether that would do for his lie. But he saw
      her again that evening, for the Baroness reappeared at her uncle&rsquo;s. He had
      little talk with her, however; two gentlemen had driven out from Boston,
      in a buggy, to call upon Mr. Wentworth and his daughters, and Madame
      Münster was an object of absorbing interest to both of the visitors. One
      of them, indeed, said nothing to her; he only sat and watched with intense
      gravity, and leaned forward solemnly, presenting his ear (a very large
      one), as if he were deaf, whenever she dropped an observation. He had
      evidently been impressed with the idea of her misfortunes and reverses: he
      never smiled. His companion adopted a lighter, easier style; sat as near
      as possible to Madame Münster; attempted to draw her out, and proposed
      every few moments a new topic of conversation. Eugenia was less vividly
      responsive than usual and had less to say than, from her brilliant
      reputation, her interlocutor expected, upon the relative merits of
      European and American institutions; but she was inaccessible to Robert
      Acton, who roamed about the piazza with his hands in his pockets,
      listening for the grating sound of the buggy from Boston, as it should be
      brought round to the side-door. But he listened in vain, and at last he
      lost patience. His sister came to him and begged him to take her home, and
      he presently went off with her. Eugenia observed him leaving the house
      with Lizzie; in her present mood the fact seemed a contribution to her
      irritated conviction that he had several precious qualities. &ldquo;Even that
      <i>mal-élevée</i> little girl,&rdquo; she reflected, &ldquo;makes him do what she wishes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had been sitting just within one of the long windows that opened upon
      the piazza; but very soon after Acton had gone away she got up abruptly,
      just when the talkative gentleman from Boston was asking her what she
      thought of the &ldquo;moral tone&rdquo; of that city. On the piazza she encountered
      Clifford Wentworth, coming round from the other side of the house. She
      stopped him; she told him she wished to speak to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you go home with your cousin?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clifford stared. &ldquo;Why, Robert has taken her,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly so. But you don&rsquo;t usually leave that to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Clifford, &ldquo;I want to see those fellows start off. They don&rsquo;t
      know how to drive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not, then, that you have quarreled with your cousin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clifford reflected a moment, and then with a simplicity which had, for the
      Baroness, a singularly baffling quality, &ldquo;Oh, no; we have made up!&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him for some moments; but Clifford had begun to be afraid of
      the Baroness&rsquo;s looks, and he endeavored, now, to shift himself out of
      their range. &ldquo;Why do you never come to see me any more?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Have
      I displeased you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Displeased me? Well, I guess not!&rdquo; said Clifford, with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you come, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, because I am afraid of getting shut up in that back room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenia kept looking at him. &ldquo;I should think you would like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like it!&rdquo; cried Clifford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should, if I were a young man calling upon a charming woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A charming woman isn&rsquo;t much use to me when I am shut up in that back
      room!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I am not of much use to you anywhere!&rdquo; said Madame Münster.
      &ldquo;And yet you know how I have offered to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; observed Clifford, by way of response, &ldquo;there comes the buggy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind the buggy. Do you know I am going away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean in a few days. I leave this place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going back to Europe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Europe, where you are to come and see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I&rsquo;ll come out there,&rdquo; said Clifford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But before that,&rdquo; Eugenia declared, &ldquo;you must come and see me here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I shall keep clear of that back room!&rdquo; rejoined her simple young
      kinsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness was silent a moment. &ldquo;Yes, you must come frankly&mdash;boldly.
      That will be very much better. I see that now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see it!&rdquo; said Clifford. And then, in an instant, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter
      with that buggy?&rdquo; His practiced ear had apparently detected an unnatural
      creak in the wheels of the light vehicle which had been brought to the
      portico, and he hurried away to investigate so grave an anomaly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness walked homeward, alone, in the starlight, asking herself a
      question. Was she to have gained nothing&mdash;was she to have gained
      nothing?
    </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude Wentworth had held a silent place in the little circle gathered
      about the two gentlemen from Boston. She was not interested in the
      visitors; she was watching Madame Münster, as she constantly watched her.
      She knew that Eugenia also was not interested&mdash;that she was bored;
      and Gertrude was absorbed in study of the problem how, in spite of her
      indifference and her absent attention, she managed to have such a charming
      manner. That was the manner Gertrude would have liked to have; she
      determined to cultivate it, and she wished that&mdash;to give her the
      charm&mdash;she might in future very often be bored. While she was engaged
      in these researches, Felix Young was looking for Charlotte, to whom he had
      something to say. For some time, now, he had had something to say to
      Charlotte, and this evening his sense of the propriety of holding some
      special conversation with her had reached the motive-point&mdash;resolved
      itself into acute and delightful desire. He wandered through the empty
      rooms on the large ground-floor of the house, and found her at last in a
      small apartment denominated, for reasons not immediately apparent, Mr.
      Wentworth&rsquo;s &ldquo;office:&rdquo; an extremely neat and well-dusted room, with an
      array of law-books, in time-darkened sheep-skin, on one of the walls; a
      large map of the United States on the other, flanked on either side by an
      old steel engraving of one of Raphael&rsquo;s Madonnas; and on the third several
      glass cases containing specimens of butterflies and beetles. Charlotte was
      sitting by a lamp, embroidering a slipper. Felix did not ask for whom the
      slipper was destined; he saw it was very large.
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved a chair toward her and sat down, smiling as usual, but, at first,
      not speaking. She watched him, with her needle poised, and with a certain
      shy, fluttered look which she always wore when he approached her. There
      was something in Felix&rsquo;s manner that quickened her modesty, her
      self-consciousness; if absolute choice had been given her she would have
      preferred never to find herself alone with him; and in fact, though she
      thought him a most brilliant, distinguished, and well-meaning person, she
      had exercised a much larger amount of tremulous tact than he had ever
      suspected, to circumvent the accident of <i>tête-à-tête</i>. Poor Charlotte could
      have given no account of the matter that would not have seemed unjust both
      to herself and to her foreign kinsman; she could only have said&mdash;or
      rather, she would never have said it&mdash;that she did not like so much
      gentleman&rsquo;s society at once. She was not reassured, accordingly, when he
      began, emphasizing his words with a kind of admiring radiance, &ldquo;My dear
      cousin, I am enchanted at finding you alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very often alone,&rdquo; Charlotte observed. Then she quickly added, &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t mean I am lonely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So clever a woman as you is never lonely,&rdquo; said Felix. &ldquo;You have company
      in your beautiful work.&rdquo; And he glanced at the big slipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like to work,&rdquo; declared Charlotte, simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I!&rdquo; said her companion. &ldquo;And I like to idle too. But it is not to
      idle that I have come in search of you. I want to tell you something very
      particular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; murmured Charlotte; &ldquo;of course, if you must&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear cousin,&rdquo; said Felix, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nothing that a young lady may not
      listen to. At least I suppose it isn&rsquo;t. But <i>voyons</i>; you shall judge. I am
      terribly in love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Felix,&rdquo; began Miss Wentworth, gravely. But her very gravity
      appeared to check the development of her phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in love with your sister; but in love, Charlotte&mdash;in love!&rdquo; the
      young man pursued. Charlotte had laid her work in her lap; her hands were
      tightly folded on top of it; she was staring at the carpet. &ldquo;In short, I&rsquo;m
      in love, dear lady,&rdquo; said Felix. &ldquo;Now I want you to help me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To help you?&rdquo; asked Charlotte, with a tremor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean with Gertrude; she and I have a perfect understanding; and
      oh, how well she understands one! I mean with your father and with the
      world in general, including Mr. Brand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Mr. Brand!&rdquo; said Charlotte, slowly, but with a simplicity which made
      it evident to Felix that the young minister had not repeated to Miss
      Wentworth the talk that had lately occurred between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, now, don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;poor&rsquo; Mr. Brand! I don&rsquo;t pity Mr. Brand at all. But I
      pity your father a little, and I don&rsquo;t want to displease him. Therefore,
      you see, I want you to plead for me. You don&rsquo;t think me very shabby, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shabby?&rdquo; exclaimed Charlotte softly, for whom Felix represented the most
      polished and iridescent qualities of mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean in my appearance,&rdquo; rejoined Felix, laughing; for Charlotte
      was looking at his boots. &ldquo;I mean in my conduct. You don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s an
      abuse of hospitality?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To&mdash;to care for Gertrude?&rdquo; asked Charlotte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To have really expressed one&rsquo;s self. Because I <i>have</i> expressed myself,
      Charlotte; I must tell you the whole truth&mdash;I have! Of course I want
      to marry her&mdash;and here is the difficulty. I held off as long as I
      could; but she is such a terribly fascinating person! She&rsquo;s a strange
      creature, Charlotte; I don&rsquo;t believe you really know her.&rdquo; Charlotte took
      up her tapestry again, and again she laid it down. &ldquo;I know your father has
      had higher views,&rdquo; Felix continued; &ldquo;and I think you have shared them. You
      have wanted to marry her to Mr. Brand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Charlotte, very earnestly. &ldquo;Mr. Brand has always admired
      her. But we did not want anything of that kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix stared. &ldquo;Surely, marriage was what you proposed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but we didn&rsquo;t wish to force her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>A la bonne heure!</i> That&rsquo;s very unsafe you know. With these arranged
      marriages there is often the deuce to pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Felix,&rdquo; said Charlotte, &ldquo;we didn&rsquo;t want to &lsquo;arrange.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am delighted to hear that. Because in such cases&mdash;even when the
      woman is a thoroughly good creature&mdash;she can&rsquo;t help looking for a
      compensation. A charming fellow comes along&mdash;and <i>voilà!</i>&rdquo; Charlotte
      sat mutely staring at the floor, and Felix presently added, &ldquo;Do go on with
      your slipper, I like to see you work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charlotte took up her variegated canvas, and began to draw vague blue
      stitches in a big round rose. &ldquo;If Gertrude is so&mdash;so strange,&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;why do you want to marry her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s it, dear Charlotte! I like strange women; I always have liked
      them. Ask Eugenia! And Gertrude is wonderful; she says the most beautiful
      things!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charlotte looked at him, almost for the first time, as if her meaning
      required to be severely pointed. &ldquo;You have a great influence over her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;and no!&rdquo; said Felix. &ldquo;I had at first, I think; but now it is
      six of one and half-a-dozen of the other; it is reciprocal. She affects me
      strongly&mdash;for she <i>is</i> so strong. I don&rsquo;t believe you know her; it&rsquo;s a
      beautiful nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, Felix; I have always thought Gertrude&rsquo;s nature beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you think so now,&rdquo; cried the young man, &ldquo;wait and see! She&rsquo;s a
      folded flower. Let me pluck her from the parent tree and you will see her
      expand. I&rsquo;m sure you will enjoy it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you,&rdquo; murmured Charlotte. &ldquo;I <i>can&rsquo;t</i>, Felix.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can understand this&mdash;that I beg you to say a good word for
      me to your father. He regards me, I naturally believe, as a very light
      fellow, a Bohemian, an irregular character. Tell him I am not all this; if
      I ever was, I have forgotten it. I am fond of pleasure&mdash;yes; but of
      innocent pleasure. Pain is all one; but in pleasure, you know, there are
      tremendous distinctions. Say to him that Gertrude is a folded flower and
      that I am a serious man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charlotte got up from her chair slowly rolling up her work. &ldquo;We know you
      are very kind to everyone, Felix,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But we are extremely sorry
      for Mr. Brand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you are&mdash;you especially! Because,&rdquo; added Felix hastily,
      &ldquo;you are a woman. But I don&rsquo;t pity him. It ought to be enough for any man
      that you take an interest in him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not enough for Mr. Brand,&rdquo; said Charlotte, simply. And she stood
      there a moment, as if waiting conscientiously for anything more that Felix
      might have to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Brand is not so keen about his marriage as he was,&rdquo; he presently
      said. &ldquo;He is afraid of your sister. He begins to think she is wicked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charlotte looked at him now with beautiful, appealing eyes&mdash;eyes into
      which he saw the tears rising. &ldquo;Oh, Felix, Felix,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;what have
      you done to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think she was asleep; I have waked her up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Charlotte, apparently, was really crying, she walked straight out of
      the room. And Felix, standing there and meditating, had the apparent
      brutality to take satisfaction in her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late that night Gertrude, silent and serious, came to him in the garden;
      it was a kind of appointment. Gertrude seemed to like appointments. She
      plucked a handful of heliotrope and stuck it into the front of her dress,
      but she said nothing. They walked together along one of the paths, and
      Felix looked at the great, square, hospitable house, massing itself
      vaguely in the starlight, with all its windows darkened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a little of a bad conscience,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I oughtn&rsquo;t to meet you
      this way till I have got your father&rsquo;s consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude looked at him for some time. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You very often say that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Considering how little we understand
      each other, it is a wonder how well we get on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have done nothing but meet since you came here&mdash;but meet alone.
      The first time I ever saw you we were alone,&rdquo; Gertrude went on. &ldquo;What is
      the difference now? Is it because it is at night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The difference, Gertrude,&rdquo; said Felix, stopping in the path, &ldquo;the
      difference is that I love you more&mdash;more than before!&rdquo; And then they
      stood there, talking, in the warm stillness and in front of the closed
      dark house. &ldquo;I have been talking to Charlotte&mdash;been trying to bespeak
      her interest with your father. She has a kind of sublime perversity; was
      ever a woman so bent upon cutting off her own head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too careful,&rdquo; said Gertrude; &ldquo;you are too diplomatic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; cried the young man, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t come here to make anyone
      unhappy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude looked round her awhile in the odorous darkness. &ldquo;I will do
      anything you please,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For instance?&rdquo; asked Felix, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go away. I will do anything you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix looked at her in solemn admiration. &ldquo;Yes, we will go away,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;But we will make peace first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude looked about her again, and then she broke out, passionately,
      &ldquo;Why do they try to make one feel guilty? Why do they make it so
      difficult? Why can&rsquo;t they understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will make them understand!&rdquo; said Felix. He drew her hand into his arm,
      and they wandered about in the garden, talking, for an hour.

      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Felix allowed Charlotte time to plead his cause; and then, on the third
      day, he sought an interview with his uncle. It was in the morning; Mr.
      Wentworth was in his office; and, on going in, Felix found that Charlotte
      was at that moment in conference with her father. She had, in fact, been
      constantly near him since her interview with Felix; she had made up her
      mind that it was her duty to repeat very literally her cousin&rsquo;s passionate
      plea. She had accordingly followed Mr. Wentworth about like a shadow, in
      order to find him at hand when she should have mustered sufficient
      composure to speak. For poor Charlotte, in this matter, naturally lacked
      composure; especially when she meditated upon some of Felix&rsquo;s intimations.
      It was not cheerful work, at the best, to keep giving small hammer-taps to
      the coffin in which one had laid away, for burial, the poor little
      unacknowledged offspring of one&rsquo;s own misbehaving heart; and the
      occupation was not rendered more agreeable by the fact that the ghost of
      one&rsquo;s stifled dream had been summoned from the shades by the strange, bold
      words of a talkative young foreigner. What had Felix meant by saying that
      Mr. Brand was not so keen? To herself her sister&rsquo;s justly depressed suitor
      had shown no sign of faltering. Charlotte trembled all over when she
      allowed herself to believe for an instant now and then that, privately,
      Mr. Brand might have faltered; and as it seemed to give more force to
      Felix&rsquo;s words to repeat them to her father, she was waiting until she
      should have taught herself to be very calm. But she had now begun to tell
      Mr. Wentworth that she was extremely anxious. She was proceeding to
      develop this idea, to enumerate the objects of her anxiety, when Felix
      came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wentworth sat there, with his legs crossed, lifting his dry, pure
      countenance from the Boston <i>Advertiser</i>. Felix entered smiling, as if he
      had something particular to say, and his uncle looked at him as if he both
      expected and deprecated this event. Felix vividly expressing himself had
      come to be a formidable figure to his uncle, who had not yet arrived at
      definite views as to a proper tone. For the first time in his life, as I
      have said, Mr. Wentworth shirked a responsibility; he earnestly desired
      that it might not be laid upon him to determine how his nephew&rsquo;s lighter
      propositions should be treated. He lived under an apprehension that Felix
      might yet beguile him into assent to doubtful inductions, and his
      conscience instructed him that the best form of vigilance was the
      avoidance of discussion. He hoped that the pleasant episode of his
      nephew&rsquo;s visit would pass away without a further lapse of consistency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix looked at Charlotte with an air of understanding, and then at Mr.
      Wentworth, and then at Charlotte again. Mr. Wentworth bent his refined
      eyebrows upon his nephew and stroked down the first page of the
      <i>Advertiser</i>. &ldquo;I ought to have brought a bouquet,&rdquo; said Felix, laughing.
      &ldquo;In France they always do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are not in France,&rdquo; observed Mr. Wentworth, gravely, while Charlotte
      earnestly gazed at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, luckily, we are not in France, where I am afraid I should have a
      harder time of it. My dear Charlotte, have you rendered me that delightful
      service?&rdquo; And Felix bent toward her as if someone had been presenting
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charlotte looked at him with almost frightened eyes; and Mr. Wentworth
      thought this might be the beginning of a discussion. &ldquo;What is the bouquet
      for?&rdquo; he inquired, by way of turning it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix gazed at him, smiling. <i>&ldquo;Pour la demande!&rdquo;</i> And then, drawing up a
      chair, he seated himself, hat in hand, with a kind of conscious solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he turned to Charlotte again. &ldquo;My good Charlotte, my admirable
      Charlotte,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;you have not played me false&mdash;you have not
      sided against me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charlotte got up, trembling extremely, though imperceptibly. &ldquo;You must
      speak to my father yourself,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think you are clever enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Felix, rising too, begged her to remain. &ldquo;I can speak better to an
      audience!&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope it is nothing disagreeable,&rdquo; said Mr. Wentworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s something delightful, for me!&rdquo; And Felix, laying down his hat,
      clasped his hands a little between his knees. &ldquo;My dear uncle,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I
      desire, very earnestly, to marry your daughter Gertrude.&rdquo; Charlotte sank
      slowly into her chair again, and Mr. Wentworth sat staring, with a light
      in his face that might have been flashed back from an iceberg. He stared
      and stared; he said nothing. Felix fell back, with his hands still
      clasped. &ldquo;Ah&mdash;you don&rsquo;t like it. I was afraid!&rdquo; He blushed deeply,
      and Charlotte noticed it&mdash;remarking to herself that it was the first
      time she had ever seen him blush. She began to blush herself and to
      reflect that he might be much in love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is very abrupt,&rdquo; said Mr. Wentworth, at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you never suspected it, dear uncle?&rdquo; Felix inquired. &ldquo;Well, that
      proves how discreet I have been. Yes, I thought you wouldn&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very serious, Felix,&rdquo; said Mr. Wentworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think it&rsquo;s an abuse of hospitality!&rdquo; exclaimed Felix, smiling again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of hospitality?&mdash;an abuse?&rdquo; his uncle repeated very slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what Felix said to me,&rdquo; said Charlotte, conscientiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you think so; don&rsquo;t defend yourself!&rdquo; Felix pursued. &ldquo;It <i>is</i> an
      abuse, obviously; the most I can claim is that it is perhaps a pardonable
      one. I simply fell head over heels in love; one can hardly help that.
      Though you are Gertrude&rsquo;s progenitor I don&rsquo;t believe you know how
      attractive she is. Dear uncle, she contains the elements of a singularly&mdash;I
      may say a strangely&mdash;charming woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has always been to me an object of extreme concern,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Wentworth. &ldquo;We have always desired her happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here it is!&rdquo; Felix declared. &ldquo;I will make her happy. She believes
      it, too. Now hadn&rsquo;t you noticed that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had noticed that she was much changed,&rdquo; Mr. Wentworth declared, in a
      tone whose unexpressive, unimpassioned quality appeared to Felix to reveal
      a profundity of opposition. &ldquo;It may be that she is only becoming what you
      call a charming woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gertrude, at heart, is so earnest, so true,&rdquo; said Charlotte, very softly,
      fastening her eyes upon her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I delight to hear you praise her!&rdquo; cried Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has a very peculiar temperament,&rdquo; said Mr. Wentworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, even that is praise!&rdquo; Felix rejoined. &ldquo;I know I am not the man you
      might have looked for. I have no position and no fortune; I can give
      Gertrude no place in the world. A place in the world&mdash;that&rsquo;s what
      she ought to have; that would bring her out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A place to do her duty!&rdquo; remarked Mr. Wentworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, how charmingly she does it&mdash;her duty!&rdquo; Felix exclaimed, with a
      radiant face. &ldquo;What an exquisite conception she has of it! But she comes
      honestly by that, dear uncle.&rdquo; Mr. Wentworth and Charlotte both looked at
      him as if they were watching a greyhound doubling. &ldquo;Of course with me she
      will hide her light under a bushel,&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;I being the bushel!
      Now I know you like me&mdash;you have certainly proved it. But you think I
      am frivolous and penniless and shabby! Granted&mdash;granted&mdash;a
      thousand times granted. I have been a loose fish&mdash;a fiddler, a
      painter, an actor. But there is this to be said: In the first place, I
      fancy you exaggerate; you lend me qualities I haven&rsquo;t had. I have been a
      Bohemian&mdash;yes; but in Bohemia I always passed for a gentleman. I wish
      you could see some of my old <i>camarades</i>&mdash;they would tell you! It was
      the liberty I liked, but not the opportunities! My sins were all
      peccadilloes; I always respected my neighbor&rsquo;s property&mdash;my
      neighbor&rsquo;s wife. Do you see, dear uncle?&rdquo; Mr. Wentworth ought to have
      seen; his cold blue eyes were intently fixed. &ldquo;And then, <i>c&rsquo;est fini!</i> It&rsquo;s
      all over. <i>Je me range</i>. I have settled down to a jog-trot. I find I can
      earn my living&mdash;a very fair one&mdash;by going about the world and
      painting bad portraits. It&rsquo;s not a glorious profession, but it is a
      perfectly respectable one. You won&rsquo;t deny that, eh? Going about the world,
      I say? I must not deny that, for that I am afraid I shall always do&mdash;in
      quest of agreeable sitters. When I say agreeable, I mean susceptible of
      delicate flattery and prompt of payment. Gertrude declares she is willing
      to share my wanderings and help to pose my models. She even thinks it will
      be charming; and that brings me to my third point. Gertrude likes me.
      Encourage her a little and she will tell you so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix&rsquo;s tongue obviously moved much faster than the imagination of his
      auditors; his eloquence, like the rocking of a boat in a deep, smooth
      lake, made long eddies of silence. And he seemed to be pleading and
      chattering still, with his brightly eager smile, his uplifted eyebrows,
      his expressive mouth, after he had ceased speaking, and while, with his
      glance quickly turning from the father to the daughter, he sat waiting for
      the effect of his appeal. &ldquo;It is not your want of means,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Wentworth, after a period of severe reticence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s delightful of you to say that! Only don&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s my want of
      character. Because I have a character&mdash;I assure you I have; a small
      one, a little slip of a thing, but still something tangible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ought you not to tell Felix that it is Mr. Brand, father?&rdquo; Charlotte
      asked, with infinite mildness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not only Mr. Brand,&rdquo; Mr. Wentworth solemnly declared. And he looked
      at his knee for a long time. &ldquo;It is difficult to explain,&rdquo; he said. He
      wished, evidently, to be very just. &ldquo;It rests on moral grounds, as Mr.
      Brand says. It is the question whether it is the best thing for Gertrude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is better&mdash;what is better, dear uncle?&rdquo; Felix rejoined
      urgently, rising in his urgency and standing before Mr. Wentworth. His
      uncle had been looking at his knee; but when Felix moved he transferred
      his gaze to the handle of the door which faced him. &ldquo;It is usually a
      fairly good thing for a girl to marry the man she loves!&rdquo; cried Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he spoke, Mr. Wentworth saw the handle of the door begin to turn;
      the door opened and remained slightly ajar, until Felix had delivered
      himself of the cheerful axiom just quoted. Then it opened altogether and
      Gertrude stood there. She looked excited; there was a spark in her sweet,
      dull eyes. She came in slowly, but with an air of resolution, and, closing
      the door softly, looked round at the three persons present. Felix went to
      her with tender gallantry, holding out his hand, and Charlotte made a
      place for her on the sofa. But Gertrude put her hands behind her and made
      no motion to sit down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are talking of you!&rdquo; said Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I came.&rdquo; And she fastened her eyes
      on her father, who returned her gaze very fixedly. In his own cold blue
      eyes there was a kind of pleading, reasoning light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is better you should be present,&rdquo; said Mr. Wentworth. &ldquo;We are
      discussing your future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why discuss it?&rdquo; asked Gertrude. &ldquo;Leave it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is, to me!&rdquo; cried Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I leave it, in the last resort, to a greater wisdom than ours,&rdquo; said the
      old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix rubbed his forehead gently. &ldquo;But <i>en attendant</i> the last resort, your
      father lacks confidence,&rdquo; he said to Gertrude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you confidence in Felix?&rdquo; Gertrude was frowning; there was
      something about her that her father and Charlotte had never seen.
      Charlotte got up and came to her, as if to put her arm round her; but
      suddenly, she seemed afraid to touch her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wentworth, however, was not afraid. &ldquo;I have had more confidence in
      Felix than in you,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you have never had confidence in me&mdash;never, never! I don&rsquo;t know
      why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh sister, sister!&rdquo; murmured Charlotte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have always needed advice,&rdquo; Mr. Wentworth declared. &ldquo;You have had a
      difficult temperament.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you call it difficult? It might have been easy, if you had allowed
      it. You wouldn&rsquo;t let me be natural. I don&rsquo;t know what you wanted to make
      of me. Mr. Brand was the worst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charlotte at last took hold of her sister. She laid her two hands upon
      Gertrude&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;He cares so much for you,&rdquo; she almost whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude looked at her intently an instant; then kissed her. &ldquo;No, he does
      not,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never seen you so passionate,&rdquo; observed Mr. Wentworth, with an air
      of indignation mitigated by high principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry if I offend you,&rdquo; said Gertrude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You offend me, but I don&rsquo;t think you are sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father, she is sorry,&rdquo; said Charlotte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would even go further, dear uncle,&rdquo; Felix interposed. &ldquo;I would question
      whether she really offends you. How can she offend you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this Mr. Wentworth made no immediate answer. Then, in a moment, &ldquo;She
      has not profited as we hoped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Profited? <i>Ah voilà!</i>&rdquo; Felix exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude was very pale; she stood looking down. &ldquo;I have told Felix I would
      go away with him,&rdquo; she presently said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you have said some admirable things!&rdquo; cried the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away, sister?&rdquo; asked Charlotte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Away&mdash;away; to some strange country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is to frighten you,&rdquo; said Felix, smiling at Charlotte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To&mdash;what do you call it?&rdquo; asked Gertrude, turning an instant to
      Felix. &ldquo;To Bohemia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you propose to dispense with preliminaries?&rdquo; asked Mr. Wentworth,
      getting up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear uncle, <i>vous plaisantez!</i>&rdquo; cried Felix. &ldquo;It seems to me that these are
      preliminaries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude turned to her father. &ldquo;I <i>have</i> profited,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You wanted to
      form my character. Well, my character is formed&mdash;for my age. I know
      what I want; I have chosen. I am determined to marry this gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better consent, sir,&rdquo; said Felix very gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, you had better consent,&rdquo; added a very different voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charlotte gave a little jump, and the others turned to the direction from
      which it had come. It was the voice of Mr. Brand, who had stepped through
      the long window which stood open to the piazza. He stood patting his
      forehead with his pocket-handkerchief; he was very much flushed; his face
      wore a singular expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, you had better consent,&rdquo; Mr. Brand repeated, coming forward. &ldquo;I
      know what Miss Gertrude means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend!&rdquo; murmured Felix, laying his hand caressingly on the young
      minister&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brand looked at him; then at Mr. Wentworth; lastly at Gertrude. He did
      not look at Charlotte. But Charlotte&rsquo;s earnest eyes were fastened to his
      own countenance; they were asking an immense question of it. The answer to
      this question could not come all at once; but some of the elements of it
      were there. It was one of the elements of it that Mr. Brand was very red,
      that he held his head very high, that he had a bright, excited eye and an
      air of embarrassed boldness&mdash;the air of a man who has taken a
      resolve, in the execution of which he apprehends the failure, not of his
      moral, but of his personal, resources. Charlotte thought he looked very
      grand; and it is incontestable that Mr. Brand felt very grand. This, in
      fact, was the grandest moment of his life; and it was natural that such a
      moment should contain opportunities of awkwardness for a large, stout,
      modest young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Wentworth, with an angular wave of his hand. &ldquo;It
      is very proper that you should be present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what you are talking about,&rdquo; Mr. Brand rejoined. &ldquo;I heard what
      your nephew said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he heard what you said!&rdquo; exclaimed Felix, patting him again on the
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sure that I understood,&rdquo; said Mr. Wentworth, who had angularity
      in his voice as well as in his gestures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude had been looking hard at her former suitor. She had been puzzled,
      like her sister; but her imagination moved more quickly than Charlotte&rsquo;s.
      &ldquo;Mr. Brand asked you to let Felix take me away,&rdquo; she said to her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young minister gave her a strange look. &ldquo;It is not because I don&rsquo;t
      want to see you any more,&rdquo; he declared, in a tone intended as it were for
      publicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think you would want to see me any more,&rdquo; Gertrude answered,
      gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wentworth stood staring. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this rather a change, sir?&rdquo; he
      inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; And Mr. Brand looked anywhere; only still not at Charlotte.
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he repeated. And he held his handkerchief a few moments to his
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are our moral grounds?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Wentworth, who had always
      thought Mr. Brand would be just the thing for a younger daughter with a
      peculiar temperament.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is sometimes very moral to change, you know,&rdquo; suggested Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charlotte had softly left her sister&rsquo;s side. She had edged gently toward
      her father, and now her hand found its way into his arm. Mr. Wentworth had
      folded up the <i>Advertiser</i> into a surprisingly small compass, and, holding
      the roll with one hand, he earnestly clasped it with the other. Mr. Brand
      was looking at him; and yet, though Charlotte was so near, his eyes failed
      to meet her own. Gertrude watched her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is better not to speak of change,&rdquo; said Mr. Brand. &ldquo;In one sense there
      is no change. There was something I desired&mdash;something I asked of
      you; I desire something still&mdash;I ask it of you.&rdquo; And he paused a
      moment; Mr. Wentworth looked bewildered. &ldquo;I should like, in my ministerial
      capacity, to unite this young couple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude, watching her sister, saw Charlotte flushing intensely, and Mr.
      Wentworth felt her pressing upon his arm. &ldquo;Heavenly Powers!&rdquo; murmured Mr.
      Wentworth. And it was the nearest approach to profanity he had ever made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very nice; that is very handsome!&rdquo; Felix exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Mr. Wentworth; though it was plain that
      everyone else did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very beautiful, Mr. Brand,&rdquo; said Gertrude, emulating Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to marry you. It will give me great pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As Gertrude says, it&rsquo;s a beautiful idea,&rdquo; said Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix was smiling, but Mr. Brand was not even trying to. He himself
      treated his proposition very seriously. &ldquo;I have thought of it, and I
      should like to do it,&rdquo; he affirmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charlotte, meanwhile, was staring with expanded eyes. Her imagination, as
      I have said, was not so rapid as her sister&rsquo;s, but now it had taken
      several little jumps. &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;consent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brand heard her; he looked away. Mr. Wentworth, evidently, had no
      imagination at all. &ldquo;I have always thought,&rdquo; he began, slowly, &ldquo;that
      Gertrude&rsquo;s character required a special line of development.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; repeated Charlotte, <i>&ldquo;consent.&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, at last, Mr. Brand looked at her. Her father felt her leaning more
      heavily upon his folded arm than she had ever done before; and this, with
      a certain sweet faintness in her voice, made him wonder what was the
      matter. He looked down at her and saw the encounter of her gaze with the
      young theologian&rsquo;s; but even this told him nothing, and he continued to be
      bewildered. Nevertheless, &ldquo;I consent,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;since Mr. Brand
      recommends it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to perform the ceremony very soon,&rdquo; observed Mr. Brand,
      with a sort of solemn simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, that&rsquo;s charming!&rdquo; cried Felix, profanely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wentworth sank into his chair. &ldquo;Doubtless, when you understand it,&rdquo; he
      said, with a certain judicial asperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude went to her sister and led her away, and Felix having passed his
      arm into Mr. Brand&rsquo;s and stepped out of the long window with him, the old
      man was left sitting there in unillumined perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix did no work that day. In the afternoon, with Gertrude, he got into
      one of the boats and floated about with idly-dipping oars. They talked a
      good deal of Mr. Brand&mdash;though not exclusively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a fine stroke,&rdquo; said Felix. &ldquo;It was really heroic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude sat musing, with her eyes upon the ripples. &ldquo;That was what he
      wanted to be; he wanted to do something fine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t be comfortable till he has married us,&rdquo; said Felix. &ldquo;So much the
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wanted to be magnanimous; he wanted to have a fine moral pleasure. I
      know him so well,&rdquo; Gertrude went on. Felix looked at her; she spoke
      slowly, gazing at the clear water. &ldquo;He thought of it a great deal, night
      and day. He thought it would be beautiful. At last he made up his mind
      that it was his duty, his duty to do just that&mdash;nothing less than
      that. He felt exalted; he felt sublime. That&rsquo;s how he likes to feel. It
      is better for him than if I had listened to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better for me,&rdquo; smiled Felix. &ldquo;But do you know, as regards the
      sacrifice, that I don&rsquo;t believe he admired you when this decision was
      taken quite so much as he had done a fortnight before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never admired me. He admires Charlotte; he pitied me. I know him so
      well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, he didn&rsquo;t pity you so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gertrude looked at Felix a little, smiling. &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t permit
      yourself,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to diminish the splendor of his action. He admires
      Charlotte,&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s capital!&rdquo; said Felix laughingly, and dipping his oars. I cannot
      say exactly to which member of Gertrude&rsquo;s phrase he alluded; but he dipped
      his oars again, and they kept floating about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither Felix nor his sister, on that day, was present at Mr. Wentworth&rsquo;s
      at the evening repast. The two occupants of the chalet dined together, and
      the young man informed his companion that his marriage was now an assured
      fact. Eugenia congratulated him, and replied that if he were as reasonable
      a husband as he had been, on the whole, a brother, his wife would have
      nothing to complain of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix looked at her a moment, smiling. &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not to be
      thrown back on my reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very true,&rdquo; Eugenia rejoined, &ldquo;that one&rsquo;s reason is dismally flat.
      It&rsquo;s a bed with the mattress removed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the brother and sister, later in the evening, crossed over to the
      larger house, the Baroness desiring to compliment her prospective
      sister-in-law. They found the usual circle upon the piazza, with the
      exception of Clifford Wentworth and Lizzie Acton; and as everyone stood
      up as usual to welcome the Baroness, Eugenia had an admiring audience for
      her compliment to Gertrude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert Acton stood on the edge of the piazza, leaning against one of the
      white columns, so that he found himself next to Eugenia while she
      acquitted herself of a neat little discourse of congratulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be so glad to know you better,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I have seen so much
      less of you than I should have liked. Naturally; now I see the reason why!
      You will love me a little, won&rsquo;t you? I think I may say I gain on being
      known.&rdquo; And terminating these observations with the softest cadence of her
      voice, the Baroness imprinted a sort of grand official kiss upon
      Gertrude&rsquo;s forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Increased familiarity had not, to Gertrude&rsquo;s imagination, diminished the
      mysterious impressiveness of Eugenia&rsquo;s personality, and she felt flattered
      and transported by this little ceremony. Robert Acton also seemed to
      admire it, as he admired so many of the gracious manifestations of Madame
      Münster&rsquo;s wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had the privilege of making him restless, and on this occasion he
      walked away, suddenly, with his hands in his pockets, and then came back
      and leaned against his column. Eugenia was now complimenting her uncle
      upon his daughter&rsquo;s engagement, and Mr. Wentworth was listening with his
      usual plain yet refined politeness. It is to be supposed that by this time
      his perception of the mutual relations of the young people who surrounded
      him had become more acute; but he still took the matter very seriously,
      and he was not at all exhilarated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Felix will make her a good husband,&rdquo; said Eugenia. &ldquo;He will be a charming
      companion; he has a great quality&mdash;indestructible gaiety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think that&rsquo;s a great quality?&rdquo; asked the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eugenia meditated, with her eyes upon his. &ldquo;You think one gets tired of
      it, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I am prepared to say that,&rdquo; said Mr. Wentworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we will say, then, that it is tiresome for others but delightful
      for one&rsquo;s self. A woman&rsquo;s husband, you know, is supposed to be her second
      self; so that, for Felix and Gertrude, gaiety will be a common property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gertrude was always very gay,&rdquo; said Mr. Wentworth. He was trying to
      follow this argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert Acton took his hands out of his pockets and came a little nearer to
      the Baroness. &ldquo;You say you gain by being known,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;One certainly
      gains by knowing you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have <i>you</i> gained?&rdquo; asked Eugenia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An immense amount of wisdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a questionable advantage for a man who was already so wise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Acton shook his head. &ldquo;No, I was a great fool before I knew you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And being a fool you made my acquaintance? You are very complimentary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me keep it up,&rdquo; said Acton, laughing. &ldquo;I hope, for our pleasure, that
      your brother&rsquo;s marriage will detain you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I stop for my brother&rsquo;s marriage when I would not stop for my
      own?&rdquo; asked the Baroness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t you stop in either case, now that, as you say, you have
      dissolved that mechanical tie that bound you to Europe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness looked at him a moment. &ldquo;As I say? You look as if you doubted
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Acton, returning her glance, &ldquo;that is a remnant of my old
      folly! We have other attractions,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;We are to have another
      marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she seemed not to hear him; she was looking at him still. &ldquo;My word was
      never doubted before,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are to have another marriage,&rdquo; Acton repeated, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she appeared to understand. &ldquo;Another marriage?&rdquo; And she looked at the
      others. Felix was chattering to Gertrude; Charlotte, at a distance, was
      watching them; and Mr. Brand, in quite another quarter, was turning his
      back to them, and, with his hands under his coat-tails and his large head
      on one side, was looking at the small, tender crescent of a young moon.
      &ldquo;It ought to be Mr. Brand and Charlotte,&rdquo; said Eugenia, &ldquo;but it doesn&rsquo;t
      look like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; Acton answered, &ldquo;you must judge just now by contraries. There is
      more than there looks to be. I expect that combination one of these days;
      but that is not what I meant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Baroness, &ldquo;I never guess my own lovers; so I can&rsquo;t guess
      other people&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Acton gave a loud laugh, and he was about to add a rejoinder when Mr.
      Wentworth approached his niece. &ldquo;You will be interested to hear,&rdquo; the old
      man said, with a momentary aspiration toward jocosity, &ldquo;of another
      matrimonial venture in our little circle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just telling the Baroness,&rdquo; Acton observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Acton was apparently about to announce his own engagement,&rdquo; said
      Eugenia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wentworth&rsquo;s jocosity increased. &ldquo;It is not exactly that; but it is in
      the family. Clifford, hearing this morning that Mr. Brand had expressed a
      desire to tie the nuptial knot for his sister, took it into his head to
      arrange that, while his hand was in, our good friend should perform a like
      ceremony for himself and Lizzie Acton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness threw back her head and smiled at her uncle; then turning,
      with an intenser radiance, to Robert Acton, &ldquo;I am certainly very stupid
      not to have thought of that,&rdquo; she said. Acton looked down at his boots, as
      if he thought he had perhaps reached the limits of legitimate
      experimentation, and for a moment Eugenia said nothing more. It had been,
      in fact, a sharp knock, and she needed to recover herself. This was done,
      however, promptly enough. &ldquo;Where are the young people?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are spending the evening with my mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not the thing very sudden?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Acton looked up. &ldquo;Extremely sudden. There had been a tacit understanding;
      but within a day or two Clifford appears to have received some mysterious
      impulse to precipitate the affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The impulse,&rdquo; said the Baroness, &ldquo;was the charms of your very pretty
      sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my sister&rsquo;s charms were an old story; he had always known her.&rdquo; Acton
      had begun to experiment again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, however, it was evident the Baroness would not help him. &ldquo;Ah, one
      can&rsquo;t say! Clifford is very young; but he is a nice boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a likeable sort of boy, and he will be a rich man.&rdquo; This was
      Acton&rsquo;s last experiment. Madame Münster turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made but a short visit and Felix took her home. In her little
      drawing-room she went almost straight to the mirror over the
      chimney-piece, and, with a candle uplifted, stood looking into it. &ldquo;I
      shall not wait for your marriage,&rdquo; she said to her brother. &ldquo;Tomorrow my
      maid shall pack up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sister,&rdquo; Felix exclaimed, &ldquo;we are to be married immediately! Mr.
      Brand is too uncomfortable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Eugenia, turning and still holding her candle aloft, only looked about
      the little sitting-room at her gimcracks and curtains and cushions. &ldquo;My
      maid shall pack up,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;<i>Bonté divine</i>, what rubbish! I feel
      like a strolling actress; these are my &lsquo;properties.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the play over, Eugenia?&rdquo; asked Felix.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him a sharp glance. &ldquo;I have spoken my part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With great applause!&rdquo; said her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, applause&mdash;applause!&rdquo; she murmured. And she gathered up two or
      three of her dispersed draperies. She glanced at the beautiful brocade,
      and then, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how I can have endured it!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Endure it a little longer. Come to my wedding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you; that&rsquo;s your affair. My affairs are elsewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Germany&mdash;by the first ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have decided not to marry Mr. Acton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have refused him,&rdquo; said Eugenia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her brother looked at her in silence. &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he rejoined at last.
      &ldquo;But I was very discreet, as you asked me to be. I said nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please continue, then, not to allude to the matter,&rdquo; said Eugenia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix inclined himself gravely. &ldquo;You shall be obeyed. But your position in
      Germany?&rdquo; he pursued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please to make no observations upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was only going to say that I supposed it was altered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I thought you had signed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not signed!&rdquo; said the Baroness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felix urged her no further, and it was arranged that he should immediately
      assist her to embark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brand was indeed, it appeared, very impatient to consummate his
      sacrifice and deliver the nuptial benediction which would set it off so
      handsomely; but Eugenia&rsquo;s impatience to withdraw from a country in which
      she had not found the fortune she had come to seek was even less to be
      mistaken. It is true she had not made any very various exertion; but she
      appeared to feel justified in generalizing&mdash;in deciding that the
      conditions of action on this provincial continent were not favorable to
      really superior women. The elder world was, after all, their natural
      field. The unembarrassed directness with which she proceeded to apply
      these intelligent conclusions appeared to the little circle of spectators
      who have figured in our narrative but the supreme exhibition of a
      character to which the experience of life had imparted an inimitable
      pliancy. It had a distinct effect upon Robert Acton, who, for the two days
      preceding her departure, was a very restless and irritated mortal. She
      passed her last evening at her uncle&rsquo;s, where she had never been more
      charming; and in parting with Clifford Wentworth&rsquo;s affianced bride she
      drew from her own finger a curious old ring and presented it to her with
      the prettiest speech and kiss. Gertrude, who as an affianced bride was
      also indebted to her gracious bounty, admired this little incident
      extremely, and Robert Acton almost wondered whether it did not give him
      the right, as Lizzie&rsquo;s brother and guardian, to offer in return a handsome
      present to the Baroness. It would have made him extremely happy to be able
      to offer a handsome present to the Baroness; but he abstained from this
      expression of his sentiments, and they were in consequence, at the very
      last, by so much the less comfortable. It was almost at the very last that
      he saw her&mdash;late the night before she went to Boston to embark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For myself, I wish you might have stayed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But not for your own
      sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t make so many differences,&rdquo; said the Baroness. &ldquo;I am simply sorry
      to be going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a much deeper difference than mine,&rdquo; Acton declared; &ldquo;for you
      mean you are simply glad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felix parted with her on the deck of the ship. &ldquo;We shall often meet over
      there,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Europe seems to me much larger than
      America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brand, of course, in the days that immediately followed, was not the
      only impatient spirit; but it may be said that of all the young spirits
      interested in the event none rose more eagerly to the level of the
      occasion. Gertrude left her father&rsquo;s house with Felix Young; they were
      imperturbably happy and they went far away. Clifford and his young wife
      sought their felicity in a narrower circle, and the latter&rsquo;s influence
      upon her husband was such as to justify, strikingly, that theory of the
      elevating effect of easy intercourse with clever women which Felix had
      propounded to Mr. Wentworth. Gertrude was for a good while a distant
      figure, but she came back when Charlotte married Mr. Brand. She was
      present at the wedding feast, where Felix&rsquo;s gaiety confessed to no change.
      Then she disappeared, and the echo of a gaiety of her own, mingled with
      that of her husband, often came back to the home of her earlier years. Mr.
      Wentworth at last found himself listening for it; and Robert Acton, after
      his mother&rsquo;s death, married a particularly nice young girl.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the

Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;
 
- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
